He is believed to have grown from a reed in the mythological swamp of Uthlanga. In the isiZulu language his name means the very great/high one. His myth is that there once was a seed that fell to the earth and from that seed grew reeds in which Unkulunkulu was made. When he grew to a big enough size the reed broke and came out of the read. He then went to explore and found that the other reeds were also growing people. He pulled off everyone and also pulled off medicine man and their dreams.
