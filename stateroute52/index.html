        Welcome to the brand new State Route 52 website! I've been wanting to
        make this project a reality for over 5 years and it's kind of surreal to
        actually be doing it. It means even more to me that you chose to come
        check out this website! I'll try to update this with new information
        relatively frequently, probably a new post whenever i have something
        very substantial to report. But in between those larger posts I'll also
        always update the site with the week's Friday Doodle. Oh yeah in case it
        wasn't clear, State Route 52 is the new name of the game. I used to just
        refer to it as "Ohio RPG" but I've been brainstorming real new names for
        like a year or so now and I've landed on one that I like. I was pretty
        sure I wanted to name it after the road you travel down in the game, but
        I had to decide on what I wanted that to be. It was originally going to
        be an Interstate, but State Routes pass through towns and go by
        interesting things in rural areas whereas Interstates are way more
        boring. Then for the number I wanted it to be a number that isn't a
        currently in-use road so I didn't have to worry about the geography
        lining up with an exact real road (The game is nominally set in Ohio but
        it isn't going to be based on an exact map or anything.) Then I chose 52
        cause it's a card game, 52 cards in a deck of playing cards, thought
        that was kinda cute. Most numbers are in use so this was the best choice
        of the numbers I had access to I think. Of course, in-game decks aren't
        52 cards they're 30, but I think it's still a fun little thing and it's
        not actually important. Mostly it just had to sound like the name of a
        real boring road which I think it succeeds at. Anyways, thanks for
        sticking around and reading this whole big scrolling text thing. It's
        gonna loop soon, but I appreciate your dedication. Or maybe you just
        started reading here and you missed all the earlier discussion about the
        game's name. That's okay too, but if you want to see that, stick around,
        cause the text is about to loop and then you'll be able to read it.
        Okay, see you!

        <b>State Route 52</b> is a Midwestern Road Trip Card Game RPG. Centuries
        after the mysterious disappearance of every human on Earth, a new
        generation of sapient animal people known as Folk have begun to reclaim
        the abandoned world. As this new people attempts to build a new
        civilization in the shadow of the old, a motley crew of nomads find a
        lone, amnesiac human passed out on the side of the road. Given only the
        instruction by a mysterious voice to follow State Route 52 northwards,
        they set out on an adventure to uncover the mysteries of the
        worldâ€”Chiefly, how and why a living human somehow wound up in the
        current day.

        Over the course of your journey, you'll meet a colorful cast of
        characters, each with their own story and personality. You won't just be
        leaving everyone you've met behind when you continue on down the road,
        though: In combat, you'll use your cell phone to call up your friends to
        come help out. You can make friends with every single character you
        meet, and each one is a unique "card" in battle, so don't be a stranger!
      </p>
      <p>
        What happened to all the humans? How did the Folk emerge, and so
        suddenly? Why have all these malevolent "ghosts" started showing up? Why
        hasn't the Clairmont Qwik-Stop ever repaired their drink machine? And
        who are you, who brought you here, and why? You'll just have to play the
        game to find out. You can't yet, cause I'm still working on it, but once
        it's done you can play it and you'll be able to learn this stuff.
