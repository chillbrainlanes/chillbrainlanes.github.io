            Florence is a recurring character you'll meet several times
            throughout your adventure. After borrowing a large sum of money from
            his Mother-in-law to pay off his gambling debts, he was forced to
            sell all of his worldly possessions to pay her back... and he still
            didn't have enough. You'll meet him at various roadside stands and
            shacks, trying to sell whatever he can find to repay his loan.
