            Tarn has lived his life on the road for nearly as long as he can
            remember. As a self-proclaimed "Adventurer", he travels the world in
            search of new people to meet, places to see, and treasure to
            collect. While he's traveled alone for his entire adult life, he
            establishes an "Adventuring Party" with his friend Mela after she is
            forced to leave her home. Kitt and the Player both wind up joining
            this group, although Tarn is initially hesitant on having to
            "babysit a couple of kids." (Both Kitt and the Player are in their
            late teens).

            He often comes off as aloof and sarcastic, but he has a tender side
            that's only seen in private with close friends— In public, he tries
            to carefully cultivate a worldly, carefree image. They'd never say
            it to his face, but most people who meet Tarn for the first time
            come away thinking he's a bit of an asshole, so this might not be
            the best idea.

            Tarn has a passion for food and cooking, and takes great pride in
            preparing meals for the party using whatever ingredients they were
            able to forage. Each morning, he can always be found awake bright
            and early preparing breakfast and a fresh pot of coffee over the
            fire— He loves black coffee, although nobody else in the party has
            quite acquired a taste for it yet.
