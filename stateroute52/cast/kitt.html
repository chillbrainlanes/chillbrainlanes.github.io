            The player's traveling companion, and in many ways the game's most
            central character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her grandparents were a part of the First Generation, and became
            renowned cartographers, archaeologists, and scholars of Forebear
            history and culture. After a falling out with her living family, she
            leaves home to try and make a new life and continue this legacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally has a cheery disposition, but often worries about the
            future. Everything she had, and everyone she knew, she left behind
            save for what she could carry on her back, despite urgings that
            "Adventurer is not a real job." She persists in the pursuit of her
            dream in some part motivated by a desire to spite those who did not
            believe in her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is fascinated by human history, especially art and music. Her most
            prized possession is a portable CD player she was able to recover in
            remarkable condition, and whenever an opportunity arises she will
            always try to search for new discs to add to her collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is not actually a child, despite her name. Gets very annoyed when
            people call her a "kid." (People do this regularly. (Tarn also does
            this specifically to annoy her.))
          </p>
          <p>
            Is able to rub together her super clingy fur to produce static
            electricity. By potentially magical means, she can form this
            electricity into Ball Lightning that she can throw. This allows her
            to help in combat by giving your phone a jolt of power or by simply
            attacking an enemy, plus help with puzzle solving by hitting far
            away objects or powering devices.
