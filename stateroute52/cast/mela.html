            Unlike Tarn, Mela isn't really a natural-born vagabond, but she
            didn't have much choice but to hit the road. The exact circumstances
            under which she was forced out of her community are a touchy subject
            that she's not keen to bring up: At this point, she just wants to
            leave that messy past behind her and begin anew. She'd been friends
            with Tarn for many years, and he happened to be passing through at
            the time— She's now been traveling with him for a little over a
            year. Unluckily, it seems like the State Route that the Player
            received a prophetic vision to follow passes straight through her
            old home town. Oh well, it's probably fine.

            Mela is often the voice of reason in the party, and despite Tarn
            fashioning himself the leader, she is often the one really making
            decisions. While she's very polite and even a bit awkward around
            strangers, she has a great rapport with Tarn and the two often get
            into lighthearted arguments.

            She's an avid baseball fan, and an enthusiastic collector of
            merchandise for her favorite Forebear team, the Akron Groomsmen.
            Back home, she was friends with a tailor who would help modify any
            shirts and jerseys she found to fit four arms, but now she's stuck
            with the ones she’s got. Mela is almost always seen carrying a
            baseball bat, which she uses in combat and for poking mysterious
            objects from a safe distance.
