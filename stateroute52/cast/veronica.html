            Veronica is Tarn’s ex-girlfriend and self-proclaimed rival. Despite
            how that might sound, they’re generally fairly friendly with each
            other. Although it seems like whenever they’re not around each
            other, they’re always workshopping the next Sick Burns they’ll throw
            at the other the next time they meet. She takes a liking to Kitt and
            the Player, though, and points you in the right direction at various
            times throughout your adventure, in addition to “testing your
            skills” in fights.

            As a Horned Lizard, Veronica is capable of autohaemorrhaging —
            Shooting blood from her eyes. This is the reason she’s always
            wearing the pair of goggles that Tarn is always quick to make jokes
            about: She only takes them off when she uses this ability. (In her
            own words it makes her "feel like Cyclops".) Like her ex, Veronica
            also has something of a caffeine dependency. In her case, it
            manifests as energy drinks rather than coffee. Her and Tarn often
            trade insults over their preferred beverages.
