            A human? On modern-day Earth? It's more likely than you'd think.
            Which is to say, you'd think it would not be likely at all, since
            all humans disappeared under mysterious circumstances over a hundred
            years ago. Still, that person who was passed out on the side of the
            road was unmistakably human. And that person was you!
          </p>
          <p>
            You have no memory as to who you are or how you wound up in this
            place and time. The only thing you remember is a strange voice
            speaking to you in pitch black darkness. It said it was happy to see
            you, and that it's been waiting for you for a long time. It then
            gave you one instruction: Follow State Route 52 north, and all will
            soon be revealed. The party of Folk who found you face down in a
            ditch are understandably a bit skeptical and confused about the
            whole situation, but Kitt's enthusiasm convinces the others to let
            you join the group, and begin an adventure to uncover the mystery of
            how and why you turned up here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarn, the team's self-styled leader, makes the decision that the
            party will be split up into two groups of 2 in order to cover more
            ground while foraging for food and treasure. Armed with Tarn's old
            cell phone and with an overzealous new friend by your side, you
            begin the journey to your first destination on the road: A small
            town in which a learned professor of Forebear history resides.
            Perhaps he will be able to shed some more light on your situation.
            Although, it sure would be nice if that mysterious voice ever felt
            like elaborating on it...
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and they don't want a human turning up to cause too much of a
            stir, so you'll need some way to conceal your identity. One giant
            cloak and a pair of cat ears later, and you've got a perfect
            disguise. Tarn always knew holding onto that novelty headband would
            come in handy.
