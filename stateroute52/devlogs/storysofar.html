      <p>
        Well, here we are! It's the first dev log for State Route 52! (Formerly
        Ohio RPG). This isn't the first time I've been sharing anything about
        this game's development. If you're reading this, there's a very good
        chance you've already been watching this game's development since I've
        been posting progress on the MSE Discord. Still, I felt like I wanted to
        have stuff about the game in one more centralized location, as well as
        just having it on my website so that people can find it easier. I don't
        use social media in any public capacity so this is kind of the closest
        thing to that lol.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're not familiar with the game, go read the blurb on the home page
        ya silly goose. If you've done that though, then you can check out the
        rest of this page to see everything that I've done for the game so far.
        This won't be any new information if you've been keeping up on Discord,
        just a compilation of where all the game's features currently stand.
        It's very early days and a lot of stuff is very bare bones, but almost
        all of the basic building blocks of narrative and combat and pretty much
        good to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that out of the way, here's quick looks at every feature implmented
        into the game! Bear in mind that all of the assets in these examples are
        placeholders, visuals are a priority for later so I'm just using a bunch
        of PMD sprites and default fonts and stuff for now.
      </p>
      <h2>Battle</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Menus for selecting actions and playing cards and using other actions.
        </li>
        <li>HUD for memory (mana), spark, and health.</li>
        <li>
          Interface for selecting slots to play cards or target with effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Battle flavor text that can update based on the actions you take and
          the cards you play.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check menu that displays information of the creatures in play, as well
          as a second page that shows any modifications those creatures have
          received and damage they've taken.
        </li>
        <li>
          A log that lets you see every action that's happened in the game.
        </li>
        <li>Icons for keywords and "summoning sickness".</li>
        <li>
          Spark actions: You have one Spark each turn and you can use it to
          attack any slot for 1 damage, gain 2 shield (which has its own HUD
          element), or discard the top card of your hand to draw a new one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creatures can attack while they're not "summoning sick" which plays a
          little animation. There's also a little placeholder particle effect
          when a creature's stats are increased and a graphic that shows up when
          transitioning between turns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Opponents with unique AI that can prioritize different things. Ability
          to assess threats to make decisions on where to play what cards on any
          given turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Opponent can play any card in the game just like the Player can, in
          addition to attack slots directly (A UI element appears on the
          opponent's turn, then the damage actually happens at the start of
          their next turn).
        </li>
        <li>
          15 unique cards, including interfaces for selecting cards from a list
          and targetting the player's or opponent's creatures, creatures that
          can modify their stats when certain game actions occur, creatures that
          can dynamically increase or decrease their stats to match certain game
          variables, and creatures with effects when they enter or get knocked
          out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Three keywords: Sneaky, which allows the creature to always hit the
          opponent directly through anything in its way. Trample, which allows
          excess damage to pierce through to the opponent when it attacks and
          knocks out a creature. And Grit, which allows a creature with it to
          stay standing at 1 health if it would be dealt lethal damage, in
          exchange for losing the ability.
        </li>
        <li>
          A fairly robust "stack" system to handle resolution of effects in a
          linear order.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>

        That might sound like a lot. And it isn't <i>not</i> a lot, I've been
        working on the game for coming up on 2 months at this point. But I've
        still barely scratched the surface. You ever try to make a save game
        system? It's a nightmare. Plus I'm still learning new quirks of the
        Godot engine every time I open it up to work, I'm a Unity and Unreal
        native so there's a lot to get used to. Plus of course all the visual
        and animation and audio stuff which I've functionally done none of yet.
        With all that said though, I'm very happy with the way everything is
        progressing, and I'm really excited to continue working on the game! It
        feels like it's really starting to get off the ground now, and I hope
        y'all are as excited as I am.

        Future dev logs will probably not have quite as much stuff as this one
        did, this was just a big catch-up basically. Watch the skies for future
        news, and you can always come back every Friday to check out the new
        Friday Doodle!
