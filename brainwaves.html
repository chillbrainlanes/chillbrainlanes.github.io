      yet
    </p>

      7/16/2024: so funny to me that elvis presley just forever claimed that

      after that one elvis.

      2/10/2024: are there any video games about being an air traffic

    <p>
      1/30/2024: guy who's never smoked but buys nicotine gum for the flavor
    </p>
    <p>

      be a really interesting question if not for the live action film skewing
      the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      1/26/2024: why do smoke detectors even use batteries. why dont we just

    </p>
    <p>
      1/15/2024: the fact that we still use x as the default variable in algebra

    <p>
      1/12/2024: we have vice principals but i think it would be a better
      example if they were virtue principals instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      1/10/2024: every edit of that "you're listening to" meme that ends with
      imagine dragons that does like, a thematic cover of the song is missing
      the point. the whole joke is that radioactive by imagine dragons
      <i>doesn't</i> fit the hard rock station. that's the whole reason it's
      funny that's the punchline. annoys me every time i see it.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      12/28/2023: it's so fucked up that you can only buy combos in the little

    </p>
    <p>
      12/27/2023: its so funny to me that michellin the tire company and
      michellin the resturaunt reviewers? yeah those are the same company. but

      unrelated.
    </p>
    <p>
      12/23/2023: in it's the most wonderful time of the year there's a lyric

      something as a single grocery. gonna start doing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      12/7/2023: people always assume the other reindeer didn't like Rudolph

    <p>
      11/26/2023: you think there's a like, a fandom for the macy's thanksgiving

    <p>
      10/28/2023: do people actually like rumble in controllers. like actively

    <p>10/27/2023: krark-clan ironworks? uh yeah i sure hope it does.</p>
    <p>
      10/25/2023: if you make a milkshake that's really thick and then give me a
      plastic straw that's so thin that it just crumbles in on itself the moment
      you try to drink it i encourage you to reevaluate where your life choices
      have gotten you.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      10/13/2023: i saw a real ice cream truck for the first time today. like
      the kind that just drives around and plays music. i've lived in the middle
      of nowhere for my whole life so i've just never experienced this before.
      and i'm sure the ice cream is good but wow that song is annoying. and it's
      so loud!
    </p>
    <p>
      10/12/2023: how much of the reason puerto rico isn't a state is because
      the government doesn't want to have to ship out new flags to every
      government building in the country. and change all their letterheads and
      graphics and stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      10/11/2023: i love that we call pizzas "pizza pies". that's so good we

    </p>
    <p>
      10/10/2023: wanted to call someone a "ninny" today but before i did i had

    <p>
      10/8/2023: can you imagine how much the character design community would
      suffer if the human body didn't scar. like if it was able to perfectly

      9/21/2023: the three stooges co op beat em up: you can beat up and push
      around your co op partners to extend combos and like pass enemies off to

      in movies when they need exposition. those aren't real are they. can you
      imagine living in an apartment across the street from one of those.

      a building across from them) can hear them. that would be the worst.
    </p>
    <p>

      grade where characters would have "photographic memory" where they could
      just remmeber every detail of everything they'd ever seen. apparently

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      9/6/2023: people always talk about tony hawk being sad about aging but the
      song he's most associated with by way of his video games (superman by
      goldfinger) is also about being sad about aging. the concept of "getting
      old and depressed" just follows this man
    </p>

    <p>
      9/3/2023: we only make one size of microwave. i think we are limiting
      ourselves. think about the size of the bag of popcorn you could cook in a
      really big microwave. (don't talk to me about making it with oil in a
      skillet that ruins the point)
    </p>
    <p>
      9/2/2023: pasta salad is so fucked up. we go through all the effort of
      cooking the pasta and then we let it cool down again. it's wrong and bad
      and i won't stand for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      8/30/23: not a new observation but god twitch plays pokemon was the
      coolest shit.
    </p>
    <p>
      8/29/23: do you think there's some guy out there who's really into
      drinking water and having it go down the wrong pipe. in like a sexual way.
    </p>
