    <p>like twitter but only for me</p>
    <p>
      9/11/2023: if rain was a fictional worldbuilding concept i'd think it was
      very silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      9/9/2023: big respect to sweet baby ray's for refusing to make their
      packaging look like their product is sold in more than like 2 stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      9/9/2023: stolen bases are objectively the funniest rule in any major
      sport. like yeah dude you can just cheat. it's cool. as long as you don't
      get caught you're good.
    </p>
    <p>
      9/8/2023: does anyone remember old chapter books you'd read in like third
      grade where characters would have "photographic memory" where they could
      just remmeber every detail of everything they'd ever seen. apparently
      that's like a real thing. what the hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      9/7/2023: my shopping list currently contains two items: toilet bowl
      cleaner and beef broth. i hope i don't mix those two up.
    </p>
    <p>
      9/6/2023: people always talk about tony hawk being sad about aging but the
      song he's most associated with by way of his video games (superman by
      goldfinger) is also about being sad about aging. the concept of "getting
      old and depressed" just follows this man
    </p>
    <p>
      9/4/2023: superhero named "burning man" who doesn't get why everyone else
      thinks his name is so funny.
    </p>
    <p>9/4/2023: "lagoon" is such a wonderful word.</p>
    <p>
      9/3/2023: we only make one size of microwave. i think we are limiting
      ourselves. think about the size of the bag of popcorn you could cook in a
      really big microwave. (don't talk to me about making it with oil in a
      skillet that ruins the point)
    </p>
    <p>
      9/2/2023: pasta salad is so fucked up. we go through all the effort of
      cooking the pasta and then we let it cool down again. it's wrong and bad
      and i won't stand for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      8/30/23: not a new observation but god twitch plays pokemon was the
      coolest shit.
    </p>
    <p>
      8/29/23: do you think there's some guy out there who's really into
      drinking water and having it go down the wrong pipe. in like a sexual way.
    </p>
    <p>8/28/23: does anyone else rmemeber react world.</p>
    <p>
      8/27/23: gay people booting up streets of rage 2 and listening to the song
      from the first level: um i um. i don't think i can do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      8/27/23: it genuinely warms my heart that there's a tumblr fandom for
      17776. shoutouts to football.
