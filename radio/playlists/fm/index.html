    <p>From Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia:</p>
    <p>
      Frequency modulation synthesis (or FM synthesis) is a form of sound
      synthesis whereby the frequency of a waveform is changed by modulating its
      frequency with a modulator. The (instantaneous) frequency of an oscillator
      is altered in accordance with the amplitude of a modulating signal.

    <p>
      FM synthesis can create both harmonic and inharmonic sounds. To synthesize
      harmonic sounds, the modulating signal must have a harmonic relationship
      to the original carrier signal. As the amount of frequency modulation
      increases, the sound grows progressively complex. Through the use of
      modulators with frequencies that are non-integer multiples of the carrier
      signal (i.e. inharmonic), inharmonic bell-like and percussive spectra can
      be created.

      The YM2608, a.k.a. OPNA, is a sound chip developed by Yamaha. It is a
      member of Yamaha's OPN family of FM synthesis chips, and is the successor
      to the YM2203. It was notably used in NEC's PC-8801/PC-9801 series
      computers.

    <p>
      The YM2612, a.k.a. OPN2, is a sound chip developed by Yamaha. It is a
      member of Yamaha's OPN family of FM synthesis chips, and was developed as
      a stripped-down version of the YM2608. The YM2612 is a six-channel FM
      synthesizer used in several game and computer systems, most notably in
      Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis video game console as well as Fujitsu's FM Towns
      computer series.
