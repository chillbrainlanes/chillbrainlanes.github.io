    "The Only Deltarune Theories You'll Ever Need."
  </p>
  <p>
    Hosts Chillbrain, Gateways, and Kayiu apologize in advance for spoiling
    Deltarune for all of our listeners at home. Unfortunately, we know EXACTLY
    what's going to happen in the game, due to our elite media literacy and
    analysis skills. That's why we're here to show the world our findings, so
    that when the game's finally complete, you'll be able to come back to this
    page and say "Damn, Weed Theory was correct all along."
  </p>
  <p>
    Each episode examines one very serious and real theory, either one from the
    community or one concocted from the minds of our genius hosts. Through
    rigorous dissection of the game's themes and symbolism, the truth will be
    unveiled. Probably. We think. We're like, pretty sure. And we think you will
    be too.
