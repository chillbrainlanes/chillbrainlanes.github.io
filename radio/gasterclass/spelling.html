      In episode 2, Chillbrain takes his cohosts through "Spelling Theory",
      which attempts to find thematic significance in Deltarune's many
      characters that spell words or use grammar in stranege waiys. This started
      as a joke theory for the joke theory podcast, but honestly I think we've
      kind of convinced ourselves that some amount of it actually means
      something. We're too far gone.
