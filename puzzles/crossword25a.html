      Last year's crossword was just something I made for fun on a whim, but a
      lot of folks really seemed to enjoy it. Or rather, they seemed to enjoy
      seeing one person in particular struggle through it. That stream was an
      absolute delight, and in it Mr. Wheeler requested that I make another
      puzzle for the next year. I was happy to oblige!
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the Serebii crosswords that inspired it, the original crossword
      wasn't really meant to be something anyone could realistically complete
      without a lot of outside help. It was just a fun "How many do you know?"
      type of challenge. However, Mr. Wheeler asked for this year's puzzle to
      exclude particular types of questions: Nothing about any card that isn't
      Vintage legal, and no questions about ancillary story and lore. With that
      in mind: Theoretically, if you had 100% perfect knowledge of every
      printing of every Vintage-legal card, and knew where all of them came
      from, you would be able to easily answer every single question on this
      puzzle. Certain clues give some extra information that's outside of these
      criteria, but none of it is necessary to solve that clue. It's just some
      extra details that might help.
    </p>
    <p>
      This puzzle clocks in at a whopping 400 Clues, 150 more than last year.
      Out of these, 99 clues come from submissions from friends and community
      members. Thank you to everyone who submitted, by the way! The full credits
      can be found at the bottom of this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's some quick ground rules to keep in mind before you jump in to the
      puzzle:<br />
      • All answers are made up of only letters. No numbers, no hyphens, no
      punctuation or any other symbols. Case also doesn't matter, naturally.<br />
      • When the answer would include one or more spaces, or a character that
      isn't a letter, write the answer without them. If there's an answer with
      an unconventional version of a letter, use the version of that letter
      found on a common English keyboard. For example "Lim-Dûl's Vault" would be
      "LIMDULSVAULT" as an answer.
      <br />• An answer can be anything, not just a card name. However, all
      answers are in English. <br />• That thing about the "pay attention to the
      capitalization in the questions!" from last year was stupid, so we're not
      doing that this time. If you don't know what I'm talking about, good.<br />
      • If you get stuck on something, the "Solve" button will fill in any
      answer for you. "OK" is the button you'll want to press if you're filling
      in a question yourself. The "Check puzzle" button will tell you which if
      any of your currently filled in answers are incorrect.<br />
      • Unfortunately, there is no way to save your progress across sessions, so
      if you want to pick up a partially completed puzzle later, you'll have to
      leave the tab open. Apologies for the inconvenience!
    </p>
    <p>
      With that out of the way, grab a drink, turn on some (festive perhaps?)
      music, and maybe go use the restroom, cause you might be here for awhile.

    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>
      These credits contain each of the clues that resulted from submissions
      from each of these lovely people. Some of them were changed to varying
      levels of significance from the original submission, but if any part of
      your submission inspired a clue, you're credited for it. If you notice a
      clue that seems similar to one you submitted but you're not credited, it's
      very likely that I came up with that same clue before you got a chance to
      submit it, or someone else submitted it before you did: This happened a
      surprising number of times.
