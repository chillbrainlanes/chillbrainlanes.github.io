      Christmas music is kind of a weird thing. For ~1 and a half months out of
      the year, everyone in the country decides that it's now acceptable to play
      music from the 50s and 60s in every public place and on half of every
      radio station. Course, a lot of people are sick of hearing pre-Rock and
      Roll easy listening hits from 70 years ago dredged up and blaring in every
      K-Mart and Taco Bell in the country, especially if you work at one, but it
      gives Christmas as a time of year a very defined sound. It's its own
      genre, even though Christmas songs span myriad different artists, styles,
      and eras.

      This inspired me to see what people think of these songs. Are they
      unimpeachable classics, or overplayed garbage? What song will stand
      victorious at the end? That's what the CLASSIC CHRISTMAS SONG THROWDOWN
      aims to accomplish.

      Obviously when it came to picking out a list of songs for this bracket, it
      was gonna be impossible to satisfy everyone. So I opted to use someone
      else's list as a baseline, to shift the blame. This bracket is based on
      <a
        href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-of-all-time-holiday-100-songs/"
        >Billboard.com's "100 Greatest of All Time Holiday Songs"</a
      >. I'm not completely certain how they came upon this list, it's not based
      on the actual Billboard charts so it was probably just a random listicle
      thrown together by an intern. But the choices made enough sense that I
      decided it was a good starting point (Although it regrettably meant my
      personal favorite Christmas song,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BIBvul7_jg"
        >Christmas Wrapping by The Waitresses</a
      >, had to be left out).
    </p>
    <p>
      The list did need a bit of processing to work, though. First, since this
      is the <i>Classic</i> Christmas Song Throwdown, I decided to remove all
      songs released after the turn of the millenium. That seemed like a solid
      cutoff point to me, I knew I had to include 90s songs since All I Want For
      Christmas Is You being excluded would've felt incredibly wrong. I also
      removed any duplicates, i.e. the same song being performed by two
      different artists/groups. In these cases I only included the higher-ranked
      version. After dropping songs that didn't fit these criteria I added the
      top 32 songs of the list to the bracket, with seeding based on their
      position in Billboard's list.
