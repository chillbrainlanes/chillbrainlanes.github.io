    <h1 class="center">the yidris travelogue: an edh deck tech</h1>
    <p>
      commander isn't my favorite format. i don't dislike it, by any stretch,
      but when it comes to deckbuilding i much prefer playing 1v1 magic. but
      it's 2024 and everyone plays commander, so i've found myself needing a
      deck i can bring to jam with friends when they're playing. i've been
      playing commander formost of my magic career, but i'd never really had a
      single deck that i put together and said "yes, this is My Commander Deck",
      and as time went on and i started spending more time (and money) on other
      formats, i decided i just wanted to have only one deck that i worried
      about upgrading.
    </p>
    <p>
      one of the things i really love about card games, and about magic
      especially, is how in the vast amount of different game pieces you can
      have particular ones that have particular sentimental value to you. and
      these games are physical, so that extends not just to the card in general
      but to a particular piece of cardboard. i've been playing this game for
      more of my life than i haven't, so i've accumulated more than my fair
      share of pet cards. that's where the idea for this deck came from: a deck
      where every single card has some sort of story behind it. ever since i've
      started building this deck, any time i've gone to an event or went to see
      a friend or anything similar, i've gotten a card to add to it. there's
      still a handful with fairly tenuous connections, plus some stuff that's
      needed just to make the deck work, but overall i'm very happy with how
      it's turned out and it's a joy to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      this article is going to go through every card in the deck, plus some
      extra stuff, and explain the story behind every individual piece. of
      course, we'll start with the actual commander.
    </p>
    <h2>commander</h2>

    <h3>yidris, maelstrom wielder</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/yidris.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      i'll be honest, the commander of this deck doesn't have any grand story
      behind it. however, this is a good time to bring up the history of this
      deck. originally, this deck was helmed by
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/378/brokkos-apex-of-forever"
        >bio-quartz spacegodzilla</a
      >
      and was built around late 2020. it was originally based on the idea of
      putting every silly frame and crossover together into one aesthetic jumble
      of a deck. it was fun for awhile, i bought an amonkhet invocation threads
      of disloaylty for it, but it became really hard to keep up with every
      single showcase frame and the deck never played great. i then later on
      came up with the idea to take the deck in this different direction, and i
      needed a new commander for it. i knew it had to be more than 3 colors,
      since i wanted to make sure i could fit cards from as many places as
      possible in there, and it had to be one that really worked with a big pile
      of unsynergistic nonsense and didn't need any particular support. yidris
      was a perfect fit: the card's powerful, in 4 colors, and just lets you see
      more cards from your deck which was perfect for the "check out all of this
      stuff" element of the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      while me and my brother actually did get a full set of commander 2016
      precons when they came out, that copy of yidris was long gone, so i
      decided to go for the new capenna showcase version, because i always
      really liked how gilded foils looked (i was trying to collect them for
      awhile, even).
    </p>

    <h2>creatures</h2>

    <h3>birds of paradise</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/birdsofparadise.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      we're gonna be going by mana cost order, organized by card type, as most
      decklist sites tend to. which means we get to start off with this beauty.
      this was a card i originally picked up for the spacegodzilla version of
      the deck, since it checked the "white border" box in terms of old card
      frames, and was both great in a vacuum and great to mutate over. course,
      it's still a great card, and i've grown very fond of these particular old
      printings saying "summon mana birds."
    </p>
    <p>
      while i did say i wanted to just have the one commander deck, that's not
      exactly true. i also have another deck that i rarely update: white blue
      birds with kagnee, aerie keeper. kangee is a pretty awful card all things
      considered, but if i've got like 12 mana in the lategame don't think he
      won't kill you. anyways, i always like to joke that i can't play the two
      best birds in magic in the birds-matter deck (birds of paradise and
      baleful strix). ledger shredder might've made that no longer true, but i'm
      still gonna keep saying it (and it's not like i own a ledger shredder
      anyways).
    </p>

    <h3>ignoble heirarch</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/ignobleheirarch.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      the first of many cards that i got from events. i opened this card at the
      modern horizons 2 prerelease... kind of. see, i was back home during that
      summer, and there's not really one game store i always go to for events
      regularly while i'm home (since they're all so far away). so i was flying
      blind coming to this event, which was being held by a game store but at an
      offsite location in a hotel. when i got there, they said that the time
      they put on the store locator was incorrect and i'd gotten there an hour
      late. apparently they'd put up an announcement on a facebook group i
      wasn't in telling everyone and didn't bother updating the store locator.
      so that was a bummer, but i decided to make the most of it and buy entry
      anyways, which paid off:i opened this guy, an esper sentinel, and a
      ragavan. i ended up trading away the ragavn day-of for 40 bucks and a
      mirari's wake, which i figured was a good deal cause he'll definitely go
      down in price from his preorder price, right? that wasn't my finest
      moment, but i'm still happy to have this little goblin: enables many turn
      3 yidrises and the exalted really does come in handy.
    </p>

    <h3>coiling oracle</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/coilingoracle.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      i sometimes joke that the only reason i still play magic is for the
      artwork. it's honestly closer to true than it should be, especially since
      they started really branching out with frames and art styles magic's been
      at the top of the game for game artwork. richard kane ferguson is one of
      if not my absolute favorite artist in the game, so i knew i had to get a
      card or two with his artwork in here. and i've always been a big fan of
      coiling oracle, so this was an easy inclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      this being a double masters 2022 printing in particular is also something
      to note. that was the set that inspired me to put together my paper
      peasant cube, which has been my biggest magic project (outside of custom
      sets) since i first made it. it's my pride and joy, and i like to think of
      this card as sort of a sideways reference to it, since i also love finding
      as many borderless artwork printings as possible to throw into the cube.
    </p>

    <h3>dark confidant</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/darkconfidant.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      one of the most expensive cards i own! picked up this bad boy from the
      streets of new capenna store championships, which are always events i love
      playing in. this one was a standard event, which i took down with a fairly
      sub-optimal but very fun mono black control deck, where i got to play one
      of my favorite cards of all time, shambling ghast. i'd also like it on the
      record that i was very ahead of the curve on invoke despair, i was running
      4 copies of that card long before it was trendy (and then got banned).
    </p>
    <p>
      i've definitely killed myself with this card in this deck before, but
      that's part of what makes it so fun. i've always loved bob and he's a
      blast to play with in this deck.
    </p>

    <h3>kiora's follower</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/kiorasfollower.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      while i started playing magic in dragon's maze, theros block was where i
      really started really being a capital f fan of magic. i would read the
      dailymtg articles every single day for the new preview cards, i was active
      on the official magic forums (remember those?), that part of my life has
      this sheen of nostalgiac joy in my mind, even though in hindsight born of
      the gods and journey into nyx were not incredible sets. boy did i buy and
      play a lot of them though.
    </p>
    <p>
      this particular kiora's follower i did not get from the game day event,
      but rather was just given it by the owner of whatever cards and games (may
      it rest in peace). he would regularly just hand out promos he didn't end
      up using to random store patrons: i vividly remembe rgetting handed entire
      20-card packs of fnm grisly salvage, launch promo magister of worth, and
      launch promo dictate of the twin gods. i've still got some of those
      kicking around, even.
    </p>

    <h3>lotus cobra</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/lotuscobra.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      another holdover from the spacegodzilla deck: zendikar rising was the most
      recently released set at the time. this one's really just here to help
      with the deck's manabase, there's not much of a story behind it. i tried
      to include as much one and 2 mana ramp as possible in the deck, to enable
      as many turn 3 yidris plays as possible.
    </p>

    <h3>orcish bowmasters</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/orcishbowmasters.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      this card's pretty good. i opened this bad boy at a lord of the rings
      tales of middle earth draft while i was in columbus for my summer teaching
      job with idtech. i have a lot of very fond memories of that summer, i
      loved the job and my coworkers, and living in columbus was a great
      experience. (i miss being able to walk places.)
    </p>
    <p>this card also has an associated token:</p>
    <img src="files/yidris/orcarmy.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      the 3 orcs on here were drawn by me, my brother, and my friend ian in the
      middle of one of the first games where i cast this card in this deck.
      they're all very handsome.
    </p>

    <h3>sakura-tribe elder</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/sakuratribeelder.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      this deck has three different 2 mana snakes that ramp. that's kinda funny.
      anyways, this card comes from the very first booster box i ever bought:
      conspiracy 1. me and my brother went halves in for it, and it sat unopened
      for awhile because we wanted to draft it, but we eventually decided that
      was probably not gonna happen so we just opened it. we had really good
      luck with the pulls two, i remember we got 2 dack faydens and a copy of
      most every other chase rare in the set. the only other booster boxes we
      ever bought were conspiracy 2 and shadows over innistrad, and i don't
      especially feel an urge to pick up another one unless i'm making a set
      cube or something, but this box was something i'll always have fond
      memories of.
    </p>

    <h3>sylvan caryatid</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/sylvancaryatid.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      this was a card i bought while i was in california last summer... for the
      second time. it's a long story that involves a lot of personal stuff, but
      it was really cool to visit the west coast for the first time. plucked
      this card out of an lgs binder at a shopping center type place we visited,
      it's basically a perfect fit, since it's also both a theros block card and
      a 2 mana ramp creature that fixes mana.
    </p>

    <h3>old rutstein</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/oldrutstein.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      the first of many cards that i got from friends. this card i traded for
      from isaac, who was the previous vice president of the university tabletop
      club before i took up that position. big fan of this character, and this
      art looks fantastic in foil.
    </p>

    <h3>slimefoot and squee</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/slimefootandsquee.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      ever since i've started going to prereleases as a group with folks from
      the university, i've been putting one card from each event into the deck.
      this was the promo i got in my prerelease box for march of the machine.
      still dunno why they did these, but this was one of the first prereleases
      we did as a group, and we had some folks who were really excited about
      these promos and built decks around them, so i guess they found an
      audience.
    </p>

    <h3>trygon predator</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/trygonpredator.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      this is probably the next card i'll be cutting, to be honest. it's another
      card from back in the spacegodzilla era, and while i do think this card is
      really strong and fun to use in commander, it's not really doing much for
      the other theme of the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      there's a lot more cards with actual interesting stories behind them i
      promise, the cheap creatures just have a lot of stuff that's here for deck
      utility.
    </p>

    <h3>druid of purification</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/druidofpurification.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      earlier this year i saw a store selling the red green precon from afr for
      like 20 bucks. don't really know how that happened, it's a deck with great
      value in it and it's fairly old at this point, but hey i'll take it. this
      card is one of the cards from that deck, and is a very fun way to include
      some extra interaction for artifacts and enchantments.
    </p>

    <h3>eon frolicker</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/eonfrolicker.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      i love otters. they're my favorite animal. when they announced there was
      gonna be a legendary elemental otter in ikoria, i was pumped. and i love
      lutri, don't get me wrong, but not being able to run him as a commander
      because they decided to let companions be the only sideboard cards allowed
      in commander was a bit of a bummer. still, we did get another otter in the
      commander precons to compensate, and this card is an absolute blast to
      play. it's super goofy but especially if you hand out the turn early in
      the game it can make you a powerful ally, and 5/5 flying is no joke. one
      of my favorite goofy commander politics cards to play.
    </p>

    <h3>erebos, god of the dead</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/erebosgodofthedead.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      for a long time this was the only secret lair i ever bought: the black
      theros god showcase lair. i got it as a birthday present for my brother,
      since all three of the cards in it (erebos, athreos, and phenax) are cards
      he's played in decks in the past, with phenax especially being his
      favorite commander. he didn't end up really using the erebos though, and
      since we both share our collection it ended up making its way into this
      deck.
    </p>

    <h3>gyome, master chef</h3>
    <img src="files/yidris/gyomemasterchef.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      this card was one i added to the spacegodzilla deck when it released, but
      the reason it's stuck around is related to the token it makes.
    </p>
    <img src="files/yidris/food.png" class="inlineimage" />
    <p>
      i don't actually know where this joke came from, but at some point when i
      needed a food token i got out my wallet
    </p>
