    <h1 class="center">f-zero 99 might be my game of the year</h1>
    <p>
      when f-zero 99 got announced i saw a lot of people really upset about it.
      part of that is expectations it couldn't live up to, a certain birdman
      leaked that there would be a new f-zero game in the direct a couple of
      days early, and speculation was abuzz with everyone's wildest hoeps and
      dreams for a new game. when it ended up being an online-only game that
      reused its assets from the original snes title, i get how that would be a
      bit of a bummer. but i also saw a lot of people taking this as a sign that
      nintendo "didn't care" about f-zero, that this was just put out on the
      cheap to fill out the switch online roster, that it wasn't a "real f-zero
      game." i saw a lot of comparisons to, of all games, metroid prime
      federation force.
    </p>
    <p>
      that strikes me as really unfair to f-zero 99. after sinking about a dozen
      hours into this game over the past week or so, i can confidently say that
      the spirit of f-zero is alive and well. and not only that, this game is
      kind of an incredible accomplishment in its own right.

      recently i was linked a great video by raycevick called
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVry84ACu0k"
        >"I Love Racing Games, They Suck!"</a
      >. the video is essentially a summary of the racing game genre as it
      stands in 2023, and that it's pretty damn sad. the simulation games aren't
      good simulations and nobody's making anything decent that isn't a
      simulation. and the few good games that are out there are horrifically
      monetized. even among indies, normally the saviors of mistreated genres,
      there's a dearth of great racing experiences, especially ones that push
      the boundaries of game mechanics. every other genre of video game is
      innovating, incorporating mechanics from different genres or riffing on
      existing ones, meanwhile racing games have gotten as far as "what if we
      had an open world" and that's about it. this extends to aesthetics too:
      when need for speed unbound released earlier this year, some die-hard
      racing fans were incredibly put off by its graffiti inspired art direction
      and visual effects, and the developers were houdned with requests to
      remove or change them. which is absolutely baffling to me because they're
      fucking sick as hell.

    <p>
      what i'm getting at is that the racing genre has been in need of a high
      profile breath of fresh air. something that can revitalize this genre,
      something that takes the same creative spirit that other game genres have
      enjoyed and applies it to racing. a freebie game from the nintendo switch
      online service is not the most likely place for this, and who knows if
      this will actually lead to any more creative and fun racing games in the
      future, but i can say with confidence that f-zero 99 is not only the best
      racing game i've played in a good long while, that it's not only a genre
      mashup that works so well you wouldn't even notice it was riffing on
      existing battle royales, but it's also just one of my favorite multiplayer
      games of all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      f-zero 99 is, on its face, a pretty faithful remake of the snes original.
      the courses are all taken directly from the first game, as are the
      vehicles, music, and basic graphics. while there have been some updates,
      with everything running at a silky smooth 60 frames per second with the
      benefits of using polygons over mode 7, it seems to be basically one to
      one. if they had just crammed 99 players onto those tracks with those
      mechanics, this game would be nothing special. even if they had gone the
      super mario 35 route and had everyone as an invisible ghost competing in
      time attack, it would've been kinda neat (i do love me some trackmania)
      but ultimately not much to write home about. but every addition and
      modification they make to the gameplay here is incredibly well thought
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      the most obvious new additions are super sparks and the skyway. this is,
      in essence, a comeback mechanic. when two cars collide, it drops some
      sparks on the ground. collecting these sparks fills up a meter underneath
      your power bar, and once it's full you can boost up to an upper path on
      top of the level called the skyway. this of course has the benefit of
      putting you above the crowded race track and its damaging walls, as well
      as providing you speed boosts while you're up there. since these show up
      when vehicles bump into each other, you're natually going to gain them
      more often the further you are back in the pack, and there will also
      occasionally spawn a large gold npc car that gives you a whole bunch of
      sparks if you run into it.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="files/skyway.png"
        class="inlineimage"
        alt="the skyway from f-zero 99"
      />
      <figcaption class="center">
        <i
          >the skyway is both an ingenius solution to a problem inherent to this
          style of game and an awesome mechanic on its own.</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      the skyway is one of f-zero 99's two answers to the problem everyone would
      immediately think of when the idea of this game is brought up: won't that
      just be totally congested and horrible? the game addresses this at the
      start of the race by creating new wide-open starting areas that let
      players slowly seperate out before throwing everyone onto the track
      proper. the skyway then serves as the solution in the mid and late game:
      while the track is more congested, more sparks will drop since there's
      more collisions, and more people boosting up to the skyway not only lets
      players bypass traffic but also lets some of the players cut ahead,
      opening up the track more even once everyone's back to ground level.
    </p>
    <p>
      despite being ostensibly a comeback mechanic, there's skill in how you use
      your "super boost" as well. the skyway's path doesn't follow the course's
      one to one, sometimes cutting over gaps in the road or turning in a
      different way. the game will never drop you on top of a turn you're not
      prepared for, and of course won't drop you off the track, so some boosts
      will last slightly longer than others while the game waits for an
      opportunity to place you back on the ground. a skilled player can
      therefore time out when exactly they use their boost to maximize their
      time riding the upper path. it can also be saved for when you're in a
      trickier situation: bypassing annoying hazards like the magnet walls in
      port town II, or just allowing you to sprint full speed at a wall, then
      boost up to the higher path when you're about to hit it to make that turn
      without losing speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      the new mechanics aren't just for players in the middle of the pack
      though. while you're running first, additional grey and red npc cars will
      spawn. the grey cars are essentially bumpers, colliding with them will
      send you flying back in the direction you came from, so they serve as
      additional hazards. the red cars, which they're often paired with, explode
      on contact, draining your power bar. (for the unaware, the power bar is
      f-zero's core mechanic. it serves as both your life bar and your boost
      meter, and the series is all about balancing the risk reward of boosting
      but not exploding).
    </p>
    <p>
      the npc gold, red, and grey cars, along with all the other players on the
      track in general, make for a much more dynamic gameplay experience than
      one would expect. you can race on the same course 10 times and have
      different strategic decisions to make every single time. this makes f-zero
      99 not just a racing game about track knowledge and mastery of the
      controls (though those are of course still incredibly important skills)
      but knowing how to adapt on the fly and change your racing lines based on
      the context you're in, even moreso than a traditional racer. it's frantic
      but incredibly satisfying when you're able to navigate these obstacles to
      a high placing finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      adding to this is the other most noticable mechanic not seen in the snes
      game: spinning and kos. your car has an attack: a quick spin that knocks
      opponents into walls and each other, that has a brief cooldown. this was
      not a mechanic that appeared in the original snes game, but rather was
      ported over from f-zero x and gx, the fan favorite installments on the n64
      and gamecube. knocking out an opponent isn't just for eliminating an
      obstacle though, as getting a ko fully refills your power bar, and even
      non-lethal collisions grant you some super sparks. this opens up even more
      unique styles of play: do you focus on bobbing and weaving through traffic
      and racing cleanly, or do you go on the offensive, aiming for kos to keep
      your power bar topped up for more frequent boosting?
    </p>
    <p>
      knocking out a player in this game really is just the most satisfying
      feeling in the world, especially since you know that was a real other
      person. it's for that reason that i think f-zero 99, more than any other
      game in the series, really delivers on the promise of f-zero as a "death
      race". this was the big selling point of f-zero x on the n64, aiming not
      just to win the race but destroy your opponents along the way, and the
      game incentivized this with the power bar refund mechanic. adding this
      element to the original game not only delivers on that in an even more
      satisfying way due to the multiplayer battle royale nature of the races,
      but also shows that f-zero 99 isn't just a pointless retread of an old
      snes launch title: it's a new sequel in the f-zero series in its own
      right, and builds upon the mechanics of the 3d titles just as much as the
      first game.

    <p>
      speaking of the battle royale format in general, i think out of all of the
      "99" type games nintendo has released, f-zero is the most uniquely suited
      for the format. like the previously most popular title, tetris 99, f-zero
      has a very high skill ceiling, and the best racers are going to come out
      in first place much more often than not due to just playing better.
      however, especially with the additions of mechanics like super sparks,
      there's just enough to keep average players coming back: you could play
      basically the same and get 80th in one race but 50th in another just by
      the natural variance of that many cars on the track, and that improvement
      is intoxicating. adding to this is the frankly ingenious "rivals" system,
      where at the beginning of a race you're assigned 4 players of roughly your
      skill level. at the race's end, you're shown how many of your rivals you
      were able to beat, which leads to even more satisfaction even if you don't
      finish in the upper places of the race overall: you still beat 2 or 3
      people who were just as good as you, and that allows you to rank up and
      unlock new cosmetic options. it's so perfectly engineered to get you to
      say "okay, just one more race", both after you do well ("i gotta see how
      much better i can do now!") and when you do poorly ("i know i can do
      better than that!").
    </p>
    <p>
      the grand prix mode is equally enthralling. this mode requires an entry of
      "tickets" earned from completing standard races, and is available only at
      certain times, so there's an inherent buy-in, adding some stakes for
      players to play their best. the mode is set up a bit like fall guys, with
      a series of races that elminate the bottom cut of players each time,
      culminating in a super tense 20-player race on the course "silence" that's
      set up just like the races in f-zero x. having an additional mode like
      this as a showcase of players' skills is such a great addition. even
      completing one of these grand prixs is a pretty big accomplishment, and
      taking first place is a true challenge few players will ever be able to
      conquer. but striving to reach those heights drives you to improve your
      racing, and keep coming back to the game race after race. it really shows
      that the developers really understood what makes battle royales as a genre
      appealing, and there's such great satisfaction in taking down so many
      actual other players at once in either a single race or a grand prix
      gauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      remember when i was talking about how racing games don't have art styles
      any more? i want to talk about this game's. because even though it just
      looks like the snes game, it's also very well done in a lot of subtle
      ways. i know a lot of fans of the series really wanted to see a new fully
      3d game, something that brings the f-zero series fully into the next
      generation. for what this game is though, i think this is actually the
      perfect style. like i mentioned earlier the game does make use of proper
      3d in some very tastefully applied ways, such as dynamically zooming the
      camera in and out, and it really makes the 2d artwork pop even more in a
      way. it honestly kind of reminds me of the "hd 2d" style of games like
      octopath traveler: while it's far less dramatic than the effects at play
      in that game, it has a similar sensation of taking old school pixel art
      and placing it in a more modern feeling enviornment to create a unique
      feeling art style (which is pretty impressive considering how many of this
      game's assets are reused). plus, not only is the snes game what the
      broadest audience will associate with f-zero (and keeping a broad audience
      is pretty important when you need 99 players looking for a game at once to
      run anything) it also allows the game to run at a silky smooth framerate
      even with a shitton of online players all moving at super high speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      frame rate is at its most important in racing games, because the sense of
      speed is so crucial to selling the fantasy of racing. that's especially
      true in f-zero, famous for being absolutely balls to the wall with its
      speed. while the enviornments in f-zero 99 don't whiz by at quite the
      speeds of a game like gx, the raw number of players creates a sensation of
      speed just as captivating. especially when you're in the thick of the
      pack, trading paint with other players in a narrow hallay or at the very
      start when everyone launches off from the starting line on a wide open
      platform, it really sells the fantasy of a high speed race to the death.
      i'm not convinced you could do that with full hd 3d models on the nintendo
      switch, at least not with the complete smoothness of the controls and
      visuals that f-zero 99 boasts. this is helped by some truly fantastic
      netcode that, even with this many players, lacks any noticable choppiness.
      when you're in the dead heat of a race, trying to make your move to finish
      in a higher place, boosting with all you've got left while dodging and
      weaving through traffic as cars explode around you, while that classic
      soundtrack amps you up, it's truly electrifying, and that feeling is what
      makes this game so special to me.

      a couple years back, a couple nintendo developers famously said that they
      wouldn't make another f-zero game unless they had a "good idea" for one.
      while that got a lot of consternation from fans, i honestly have to agree.
      f-zero gx is kind of the perfect version of itself. beyond just adding new
      tracks and such i don't really know what you do to improve that game that
      doesn't just make it something different. while that doesn't really excuse
      that game not getting a port or rerelease in the last 20 years, it makes
      me totally understand why this is the direction they went with the next
      f-zero title. i've got a couple gripes with it (it's a liiiiittle light on
      courses and vehicles at the moment, and being able to host private lobbies
      or play bot matches on demand would be fantastic features), but all things
      considered, even though this was not at all what i imagined from a new
      f-zero title, i couldn't be more happy with it. if you haven't yet, i
      implore you to give this game a shot. it's free if you've got switch
      online, and if you don't, grabbing a couple months is pretty cheap and
      lets you play the pokemon trading card game for game boy color so really
      it would be worth it for that alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      unfortunately it doesn't have the f-zero x annoucner though, so until they
      add him in a patch this game can't be my game of the year. sorry nintendo
      i don't make the rules. i need to hear "YEAH! THE FINAL LAP!" in a new
      game.
