    <h1 class="center">why i love fanworks</h1>
    <p>
      or: how reading a bunch of furry webcomics helped me understand the nature
      of art
    </p>
    <p>
      earlier this week i was listening to an episode of
      <a href="https://luckypaper.co/">lucky paper radio</a>. it's normally a
      super chill mtg cube podcast (if you don't know what that is don't worry
      about it) but there's one episode every year where they allow themselves
      to be just a little bit bitter, and that's the "state of the game".
      basically they go through mark rosewater (lead designer of magic)'s yearly
      <a
        href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/state-of-design-2023"
        >state of design article</a
      >
      where he talks about the successes and failures of the year's expansions.
      the hosts discuss what they agree with, what they disagree with, and their
      overall thoughts on where magic is headed.
    </p>
    <p>
      magic has grown an insane amount in the last 10 years, and there's been
      much talk in the community about how that's changed the way the game is
      made. importantly for the purposes of this article, part of the way
      through the episode the hosts start digging into the idea of "artistic
      integrity."
    </p>
    <p>
      i won't get too deep into it because i'm sure there's people who don't
      play magic who will read this but basically, there was a set last year
      called unfinity. it was the fourth in the series of "un-sets", which were
      created to be sets that weren't tournament legal and didn't have to follow
      those rules, so they got to be really goofy: from caring about the artwork
      of cards to dexterity challenges to generating card abilities based on a
      website. that was the identity of these sets, and players loved that.
      unfinity marked a change, though. because these cards weren't strictly
      "legal" in magic's formats, a lot of players didn't see them as "real
      magic cards", and so even in casual games they refused to play against
      them. of course, that meant the sales of these sets were always more
      limited. that's bad news for a multi-billion dollar company like hasbro,
      so the team behind unfinity came up with an "ingenious" solution. just
      make a bunch of the cards legal.
    </p>

      <img
        src="files/gamer.png"
        class="inlineimage"
        alt="the scryfall page for the most dangerous gamer. it shows it's legal in a bunch of formats"
      />
      <figcaption class="center">
        <i
          >there is now a part of the magic comprehensive rules that defines
          what a "gamer" is.</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      this led to all the problems you can imagine it leading to (shoutouts to
      my friend pipsqueak who plays comet in legacy), but to the hosts of lucky
      paper radio this was not only a bad and confusing move for players but it
      also betrayed the entire point of un-sets. no longer were these sets a
      testing ground or a place for fun stuff, now it was just another set for
      commander players, a mismatched mess of a product that, in host andy's
      words, lacks artistic integrity. there was an artistic goal behind the old
      un-sets that has been lost, and players can "taste" that.
    </p>
    <p>
      putting aside any of the specifics of unfinity, this idea that people can
      taste when a piece of art is lacking in integrity was interesting to me. a
      specific example andy cites is the fast and the furious. these movies
      always make an incredible amount of money, but he argues there's very few
      capital f Fans of the series out there. it exists to be chewed and then
      spit out because it sounded like a fun way to spend your friday. the
      things that captivate peoples' imaginations are things with that
      integrity, things that have a clear and definied vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      of course, the problem with a clear and defined vision is that some people
      won't like it. and if some people won't like a thing then we can't sell it
      to them. bad news!

      <figcaption class="center">
        <i
          >well the fast and the furious has gotta have at least some dedicated
          fans or else this probably wouldn't exist</i

    <p>
      i'm sure this is not new information to you, reader. if you've ever
      thought critically about media in your entire life you've probably come to
      the conclusion that design by committee and creating things with only an
      incentive for maximum profit is, shockingly, bad! nothing wrong with
      enjoying a good blockbuster, of course. nothing is ever fully, truly
      designed by committee because there's always still singular writers and
      artists who have to make decisions about things. but if your primary goal
      for making a piece of art is to get people to buy it, people can tell, and
      they don't usually like it very much. (or at the very least they like it
      but don't love it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      that goes to explaining why tons of people love independent media. in
      indie games and the books by small authors and weird niche bands you get
      to experience the creative vision of an individual or a small group of
      likeminded people. people who make the things they would like. people who
      take all their unique experiences, their influences, their everyday lives
      and the events that have shaped them into the complicated, unique people
      they are, and turn that into art. oftentimes that art is weird or
      inscrutable or just plain offputting, but that's exactly what makes it
      compelling. in the same way we can taste when something lacks artistic
      integrity, we can taste when something has it, even if we don't like the
      thing in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      but what does that have to do with <i>fanworks</i> in particular? and when
      are we gonna talk about all the furry webcomics?
    </p>
    <p>
      well, i listened to the podcast episode with the discussion of artistic
      integrity at a pretty funny time. because over the past few weeks i've
      gotten really into reading a bunch of pokemon mystery dungeon webcomics,
      and especially after marathoning a bunch of them cover to cover it had
      made me reflect on a similar thing just the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      i got really into pmd around spring of 2020, because i couldn't go outside
      so i might as well get obsessed with something. mentally i was in a pretty
      rough spot at the time (i hope understandably), so playing through a very
      simple but very emotionally resonant story, alongside the nostalgia of
      playing a pokemon game on my old ds, really hit home in a very profound
      way. it also certainly helped that the first new-ish game in the series in
      5 years had just released a month or so ago, so the fandom was really
      revitalized. playing through each of those four games and talking about
      them with my newfound friend group is something i have so many fond
      memories of. i even played through gates to infinity all the way through
      in discord voice calls alongside a bunch of big fans of the game, which
      i'm sure contributes at least some to why that game is my favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      even when i was first playing through the games, though, i felt like a lot
      of my favorite things about the games weren't things the game spent much
      time on. i loved the characters, but there's a lot of missing pieces in
      their stories that are left for you to fill in. (what's the deal with that
      "resistance" that grovyle mentions one time in special episode 5 and never
      comes up again?) there's a lot of fascinating worldbuilding, but a lot of
      it is purely through implication (why are there abandoned human research
      labs in rescue team when there's no humans anywhere to be found?) to me it
      feels like pmd was practically tailor-made for fanon and fandom, to get
      your imagination racing about your self insert little guy and their friend
      and this fascinating setting that's so different from anything else in the
      pokemon franchise: there's a reason so many people have pmd oc's compared
      to main series pokemon oc's. and i of course was not immune to this,
      before i even finished explorers i was thinking of stories i could write
      or art i could draw and any number of other ideas.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0gn8Rg_7wE&"
        >(i did make a pmd fanwork that year but it wasn't really something that
        explored the characters or the setting it was basically a 2 hour long
        shitpost.)</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      i did read some pmd fanfic and stuff during this time (shoutouts
      <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/27545284">prism globe saga</a>
      shoutouts <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=42766&p=1">victory fire</a> i hope
      either of you get finished someday) but eventually my obsession faded into
      merely "i really really like this thing" rather than "i spend every waking
      moment thinking about this thing." but that was still enough to make me
      interested when my friend posted this discord message:
    </p>
    <img
      src="files/orbs.png"
      class="inlineimage"
      alt="a discord message from my friend nat that says 'This pmd comic has spent like a month of updates explaining how to make orbs'"
    />
    <p>
      and that started the month-long binging of pmd webcomics i mentioned
      earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      but enough personal anecdotes. let's talk about how one of these comics in
      particular was so batshit insane that it made me want to write this
      article.

      <a href="https://shinka.webcomic.ws/comics/first/"
        >shinka: the last eevee</a
      >
      is a webcomic written by silver lunarwing. it starts how it means to
      continue, with the following prologue:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        >I remember the sins that killed the Earth.<br />
        I remember our trees, turned to ash before our eyes.<br />
        Our homes fell to rot and ruin, <br />
        And our people prayed to the heavens, asking <br />
        "Dear God, why have you forsaken us?"<br />
        Our runes were wrong. <br />
        Our prophecies lied. <br />
        But in the face of a dying Earth, <br />
        One person sought salvation. <br />
        ...The story I am about to tell you may not have a happy ending. <br />
        But it may as well be me who tells you. <br />
        And it may as well be you who listens. <br />
        For if you must take away one lesson, <br />
        Let it be this: <br />
        Darkness is coming, <br />
        But our fate is not set in stone.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      pretty wild shit from a comic based on a series whose first antagonists
      were named "team meanies". and that's kind of exactly why i love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      or, maybe "love" is a strong word. this comic goes from three kids running
      around town trying to stop common criminals to a gnostic death-cult that
      worships the bones of dead elder gods kidnapping and starving our main
      protagonist for use in a ritual sacrifice. i'll be honest, i'm not 100% on
      board for every single plot point in this story, it goes more than a
      little bit further in terms of tone than i tend to like in my pmd, and it
      hits a handful of pretty groan-worthy cliches (i'm sorry but you have to
      do a really good job with it to make me like a plot point that involves
      introducing the main character's long lost father.) but through all of
      that, this comic still captivated me. i always wanted to see what happened
      next, i got genuinely invested in these characters and this world and what
      was going to happen to it. in a way i really didn't expect to.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="center">

          >mfw i learn i have been hunted since birth because my blood is needed

        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      there's a lot you can say about this comic. it's strange and it's
      offputting and it's certainly "cringe". but what you cannot hold against
      it is a lack of artistic integrity. this author had vision. they knew what
      they wanted to make and they made it. who knows if they even cared if
      anyone else saw it. they don't care if you don't like it, they're going to
      keep making it. you feel that in every page, every line, every choice made
      in the creation of this story. that's not unique to shinka, of course, but
      through this comic's wild plot i felt it especially profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      in the grand scheme though, is it <i>that</i> weird? i mean, this seems
      like a fairly standard campy dark fantasy plot. there certainly exist much
      weirder premises, much darker stories, much more of everything this comic
      does in countless other pieces of media. what makes this random pokemon
      fanfiction any more remarkable than anything else people make?
    </p>
    <p>
      the answer to that is kind of nothing. i wouldn't call this comic high
      art, i don't even know i could confidently call it great storytelling. but
      i think that if this <i>weren't</i> a pokemon fanfiction, there would be
      quite a lot lost in its appeal. this isn't just one person's creative
      vision, it's this author's interpretation of a world so many of us are
      familiar with. it takes the familiar character designs and lore elements
      of pokemon and says "here's what i would do with them." and it turns out
      what they would do with them is creating an entire new magic system where
      astrology is real and also it will kill all of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      what makes fandom special, as a concept, is that everyone approaches a
      piece of art from their own perspective. all that stuff that turns someone
      into a one-of-a-kind person that i mentioned earlier influences the way we
      consume media and interpret it, not just create it. you ever watch two
      movies or read two books or play two games back to back and then start
      thinking about them in relation to each other, even if they have nothing
      to do with each other? what would happen if this character met that
      character? what if this scene happened in this other style? what if you
      could play as this character in this game? or what about listening to a
      song and imagining a little music video in your head? any given time
      that's happened, you might well be the first person on earth to ever
      associate those things in that way. even subconsciously, we have
      pattern-seeking brains that drive us to make those connections, and
      whenever multiple people have the same experience, they're going to
      connect things to that experience in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      just having a conversation with someone who's passionate about the same
      thing as you is great, but fanworks allow us to experience this in an even
      more profound way. through the medium of creation you get to step into the
      shoes of this person, and learn where their mind traveled when they saw
      that scene or learned about that element of the world. what they value
      about it and what they don't. what other things they like that they
      connect and fold into it. reading six full pmd webcomics over the course
      of a month has been especially fascinating for this reason: what
      influences do these authors share, and what directions do they go that are
      different? especially with pmd being such a blank canvas for unique fan
      interpretations, it's been genuinely really cool to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      and that's not to mention what is to many people i'm sure the greatest
      part of fanworks: if the official creators don't go in the direction you
      liked, there will be fan authors who can pick up the slack.
    </p>
    <p>
      all art is a reflection of its artist, of course, but what i love about
      fanworks is how much those elements are spotlighted, in taking the
      familiar and running with it in creative directions. is any given
      fanfiction author, dilligently chipping away at the high school au that's
      been festering in the back of their brain, a genius artist? probably not.
      but especially in an era of multi-billion dollar focus-grouped
      <i>Cinematic Universes</i> and <i>Intellectual Properties</i> gobbling up
      so much of the media landscape, i think it's easy to argue that that
      author has a great deal more artistic integrity. and whether or not you
      like what they're making, whether you think it's "cringe", or whether it's
      even any good, they are making it because they want to make it. that is
      the incentive, that is the point. they are painfully and hopelessly
      earnest. they are an artist, in the most pure sense of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      the world we live in has taught us that everything needs to be a means to
      an end, everything needs to be transactional, and if you're not good at
      something there's no sense in doing it. that betrays the fact that art,
      the act of creation and self-expression, is a vital part of what it means
      to even be a person. you are the only person who can create the things you
      create. fanworks may be self-indulgent and they may be "cringe", but, at
      least to me, they're a vital part of our culture. and if you want to make
      one, it holds no less value than anything else anyone's ever made.
