      <h1>chillbrain lanes magic trivia crossword 2024</h1>
      <p>
        merry christmas and happy holidays! inspired by
        <a href="http://advent.serebii.net/crossword.shtml"
          >the awesome serebii.net advent calendar crosswords</a
        >, i put together this great big 250-question magic trivia crossword.
        some of the clues are easier, some are harder, some are downright cruel.
        some you can easily solve with scryfall, but many you can't. completing
        the whole thing will require great knowledge of a ton of magic
        esoterica, it'll be a real challenge!
      </p>
      <p>
        a couple quick notes:<br />
        • unless otherwise stated, all questions include silver-bordered cards,
        alchemy cards, astral series cards, promotional cards, heroes of the
        realm, basically anything wotc has made and called a magic card is fair
        game<br />
        • punctuation and spaces are excluded from answers, but both letters and
        numbers can occur<br />
        • credit to newmoonequinox, pywo, caine ghest, broteinmanganiello, and
        sibwow for contributing questions. major shoutouts to
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Chorocojo">chorocojo</a> as well: i
        got a good amount of trivia from their series random card talkin', their
        channel is a must-subscribe if you like magic trivia<br />
        • if you ever get stuck or know you won't know a question, don't be
        afraid to use the "solve" button to skip it. the "check puzzle" button
        at the bottom will also tell you how many answers you've already filled
        out that are incorrect.<br />
      </p>
      <p>hope you enjoy!</p>
