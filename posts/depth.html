    <h1 class="center">depth, simplicity, and how to have both</h1>
    <p>
      recently, the biggest news in the card games scene has been ravensburger,
      creator of wildly popular 7/10 board game disney villainous (and
      apparently also the largest manufacturer of puzzles in the us, i just
      learned that) launching their brand new tcg based on disney cartoons,
      called lorcana. obviously, with the disney license this game was gonna
      succeed of the backs of collectors and casual players alone. but when the
      game was annoucned i saw a lot of speculation within card game communities
      i frequent that, if they play their cards right and create a geuinely
      great game, they could absolute cement themselves as a mainstay of the
      genre. with pokemon and yugioh sequestering all their organized play to
      dedicated events, allowing major organizers like star city games to run
      lorcana alongside magic and flesh and blood at major events would drive
      major competitive interest in the game. and disney if anyone has the money
      to throw around with regards to prize pools and providing prize support to
      game stores to drive local play. the intersection of casual players and
      the aspiration of competitive play would be a perfect winning storm for a
      game like this, and it's unique situated to do it. all they have to do is
      get people on board with a truly excellent game.
    </p>
    <p>lorcana is, unfortunately not that game. at least not yet.</p>
    <p>
      lorcana's system mechanics are actually fairly solid. it does have a hard
      cap of two factions per deck, which i'll hold against any card game, and
      its "questing" mechanic can lead to some boardstates where one play is
      able to just build up a board of creatures and then use them all at once
      to win, due to the lack of cards that can be played on your opponent's
      turn and your main method of interaction only opening up once a creature
      has quested on its owner's previous turn. but what card game doesn't have
      system issues? the key is creating designs that emphasize and encourage
      the intended gameplay and make those rough points less egregious. and
      well,
    </p>

      <img
        src="files/hans.png"
        class="cardimage"
        alt="hans, scheming prince, a 4 cost 3/3 that quests for 3"
      />
      <figcaption class="center">
        <i>imagine opening a vanilla 4 mana 3/3 as your rare.</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      so i want to preface this by saying: i don't hate every lorcana card
      design. there are some actual pretty fun cards and synergies to be
      discovered here, and there's not 0 variety in the decks people are playing
      at the top level. but those cards do not make up the majority by any
      means. looking at all the character cards at rare or higher in the game, a
      vast majority have either no ability, one or two keywords, or one
      one-sentence tap or static ability. and that last category is the smallest
      by a fair margin, even at the highest rarity.

    <p>
      it's easy to understand why they did this. this game has attracted a huge
      number of people who have never played a card game in their lives,
      including i'm sure a bunch of actual kids (though at the events i've seen
      it's been mostly disney adults). but the problem with making a game that's
      simple to a fault in this way is that it doesn't hook people.
    </p>
    <p>
      paragraph about how pokemon tcg decks are made of simple cards that have a
      lot of decision points
    </p>
    <p>
      this depth doesn't just extend to the top-tier tournament decks either!
      for the sake of example, let's take this junk rare that i opened today out
      of a pack of the mot recent set, obsidian flames.

      paragraph about how even though this card isn't great it's aspirational
      for casual players
    </p>
    <p>
      a great card game can (and should) be a medium for expression and
      creativity. and the benefit of the genre is that they can be combined and
      played with and against each other in near limitless ways. a great card
      game will reward a player who experiments and tries out a unique strategy-
      if they find one that works in the meta. that's why so many long-running
      card games will have incredibly powerful decks that go essentially
      undiscovered for months, even years at a time. all the pieces were there,
      they just needed someone creative and driven enough to find the right way
      to combine them.

      />
      <figcaption class="center">
        <i
          >well unless this happens. (they did, in fact, win a paper pioneer
          tournament with this deck btw)</i
        >

    <p>
      if you're going to go through all the trouble of creating all these unique
      game pieces, players should have a reason to use as many of them as
      possible. otherwise it certainly seems like a lot of that effort is going
      to waste. of course, every card game is going to have bad cards, that's an
      inevitability. but there's a big difference between "every card is
      powerful" and "you can do something cool with every card."
