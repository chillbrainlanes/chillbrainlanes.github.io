      if you know me for anything it's probably the 2022be, a very silly custom
      powered mtg cube that i posted one card from every single day of 2022. i
      still see That Timy My Uncle Tony Lightning Bolted Someone in memes
      channels in magic discords sometimes. if you want to check it out it's got
      its own much more professional website
      <a href="https://www.22be.net/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      i also make tabletop games, most notably tamer tournament, which is an
      adaptation of the autobattler genre as a card game with a monster-battling
      theme. you can check that out (and buy it)
      <a href="http://casey.place/tamertournament">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      there's also marmalade gumbo, which is a party game about combining
      unconventional ingredients into strange and hilarious dishes. you can
      check that out
      <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/marmalade-gumbo">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      as far as other fanworks, i've made a couple other custom magic projects.
      the big completed expansions i've made are
      <a href="https://revolution-manifesto.herokuapp.com/card?q=e%3Avrd"
        >viridian's last mission</a
      >, an urban fantasy world inspired by super villains, super spies, and
      building up to big plays, and
      <a href="https://www.planesculptors.net/set/song-of-jannada#cards"
        >song of jannada</a
      >, a sequel to an old project that brings the cosmic horror of the divine
      to a sub-saharan african inspired fantasy world. i also made a mod for the
      old magic pc game called shandalar 2003, you can find that
      <a href="shandalar.html">here.</a>
