        Uh, content warning for homophobia and transphobia in this one? I guess?
        Like it's literally random throwaway lines you're definitely gonna be
        fine. But better safe than sorry.

      There's not much left to say about RBY. It's the first and most iconic
      game in the most popular media franchise in the world, it's like trying to
      find new things to say about the first Star Wars movie. So instead, I'm
      just gonna say some things that other people have already said before. I
      like how there's some nonlinearity in the middle part of the game here. I
      could've done Gym 4 before the Game Corner and Beast Tower, and I could
      even put it off for longer if I wanted. Having that little bit of open
      design helps to make each playthrough feel a little bit more personalized,
      which is important for Pokémon.

      These NPCs are literally back to back it's so funny. This does also
      confirm that Stella is actively nonbinary, rather than just left
      ambiguous. I kind of had a feeling/hope this would be the case, but
      honestly I wasn't expecting there to be any dialogue actually confirming
      this. Pretty hilarious that probably the only dialogue that mentions this
      is someone being hateful towards you, but oh well.

      So, Grass gym full of lesbians. I guess you could argue this is just
      taking the subtext from the vanilla game and making it text, but I feel
      like whenever I've heard unfunny internet users make gags Erika's gym,
      they always go for the weed angle and not the lesbian angle. Maybe that
      has more to do with most of the humor well of Gen 1 being run dry back in
      the "LOL, MARIO DOES MUSHROOMS!!!!" era. I'm sure there's plenty of people
      drawing the obvious conclusion of "gym where only women are allowed" these
      days.

          gardening. if you didn't want to use a watering can i guess? this
          doesn't make any sense when i say it out loud</i

    <p>
      There aren't any new Starbies among the gym's trainers, just the usual
      Mosstons, Veilumbers and Weedimps you'd expect. Oddly, one trainer
      specifically mentions that they only use Grass Beasts, but another
      trainer's team was a Sackran and a Bagavond, neither of which are Grass.
      Bagavond is definitely in hindsight one of Sackran's two evolutions, but
      I'm still stumped on why they'd be here. Maybe this game just really
      doesn't have enough Grass types?
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a couple new trainer sprites though, the Beauty from above and
      this Ranger, who I think is replacing the female Cooltrainer? Will the
      rest of the Cooltrainers still be in this game? Only God and Soul Valor
      know, and God probably has more important things to worry about.

      Lisbeth, the Gym Leader, is described on the sign outside as "The rough,
      tough gardening buff!" So you can probably intuit her character design and
      personality just based on that.

      Oh, and at this point I've fully come around on the Club Master battle
      theme for the Gym Leaders, by the way. I think I was just put off since I
      was expecting a high-energy track, with that being what the original game
      had. But I think this track fits normal battles just fine.

      My prediction about Weedimp's final forms was incorrect (seems like Lucian
      is gonna have the Dark Soul one, I bet a different NPC is going to have
      the Holy Soul one), but I was correct that she'd have a more balanced team
      as opposed to a single standout ace. Unfortunately for her, all three of
      her Beasts got outsped by Tubi and one-shot by Falcon Punches. But I did
      do two whole dungeons I didn't need to do yet before fighting her, so it
      was sort of bound to end up like this.
    </p>
    <p>On the upside, all three are new Beasts! Let's have a look.</p>

      With the Mega Drain TM (Nothing I cared much about could learn it) and the
      Pride Badge (I didn't even think anything of this name when I saw it in
      the list back then. But, lol.) in tow, we better head out and free Saffron
      City from Team Rocket's clutches. Seems like they're having a bad time if
      none of them want to leave their houses.

      We're gonna be jumping around a bit in Silph Co. I fought every trainer,
      but most of them weren't very interesting so I'm gonna just be skipping
      around to the interesting bits. There is a unique music track here in the
      building, and it sounds <i>so</i> familiar, but I can put my finger on
      what it is. If anyone else plays this game and is able to identify what
      this song is, please let me know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scientists don't use the Rocket battle theme, which is the case in the
      canon games later on but always bothered me there as well. Also, this guy
      is confused about my gender in the opposite way as the gym trainer from
      earlier.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/daughter.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">

          >afterwards he said he "didn't get paid enough to care" which is

    </figure>
    <p>
      In general, the Rockets here have a lot of the Slimogg and Zapodi lines,
      but in general I'd say there's a bit more variety in the Beasts they use
      than in the originals. Stranghost, Electrio, Cracture, Tearwulf, Slasher,
      Eggerot, Malevolos, Tomaroc, Trapestry, O'Grue, Embalmak, Convlusia,
      Warnado, Ardyhydra, Infestin, Slashopper, and Deathseer were all Beasts I
      saw at least once on the teams of the Grunts. This game's got a lot of
      designs that feel "evil", thinking about it now. And if you don't remember
      what all of them look like, well, I guess you're just not a real Star
      Beasts fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looks like TM AI Mk. 1 was being worked on here at Silph originally,
      before being relocated to the laboratory in Celadon. Probably a good thing
      that the Rockets didn't get a hold of it, and a fun bit of world
      interconnectivity that also gives people a hint to go to Celadon and find
      this if they haven't yet.

      Elsewhere, there's a Juggler. All his dialogue gave every indication that
      he's working with Team Rocket, he says "It's a long way to my BOSS!" when
      you beat him. But like, why? Why is he a Juggler? I don't understand.
      Maybe that's the joke.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >i said this before but while i do appreciate the commitment to giving

      </figcaption>

    <p>
      As Jugglers are want to do, this guy loved swapping out his Beasts. This
      meant he actually got to take actions while being Wrapped, since the swap
      will always go before the next Wrap gets a chance to land. This didn't
      accomplish anything, but I guess it's more than most trainers get to do
      against Wrap. He also swapped into a new Beast, which is exciting.

      Speaking of new Beasts, it's been like 4 new ones since we've seen another
      Steel type. Let's get another one of those in here. For old time's sake.
      Because I guess Veilumber is a split evolution.

      Oh and by the way, assume that this entire dungeon is interspersed with
      frequent return trips to the Star Beast Center to restock on Wrap PP. I'm
      glad this place has the elevator to make that easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In TM news, we found Take Down, which is pretty embarassing to get this
      long after Body Slam to be honest. I guess it is technically higher Base
      Power but like. Come on now. Especially as compared to the other TM in
      this dungeon, it looks awfully silly.

      Everyone on the team except for The Peeker can learn Earthquake, so I had
      to check the Attack stats of my team. Rocky Dan has the highest by a
      pretty significant margin, and the more I thought about it the less I was
      sure I was ever gonna want to use Selfdestruct. Flash Cannon and Rock
      Throw were usually good enough at dealing with anything Selfdestruct would
      hit for neutral damage that I didn't need it. Felt like I was just waiting
      for the perfect target that I just needed to absolutely destroy. But I
      don't know what I'd even be waiting for...

      Well, I'm sure glad I held onto that. With the horrible fiend vanquished,
      we can now safely replace Selfdestruct with Earthquake. Incidentally, the
      trainer who had this thing was a lady Ranger who was trying to pretend she
      was a civilian in need of saving, but was actually working for Team
      Rocket. This makes her, as far as I've seen, the only female member of
      Team Rocket in the whole game. An inspiration to us all.

      There's been a handful of folks around the office murmuring about a "fat
      man" guarding the door on the top floor, who's apparently Lucian's
      personal bodyguard. Sounds like we might be in for a little mini boss
      rush, between Varik, this guy, and Lucian at the end.

      Just a couple last small things before we grab the Card Key and run into
      Varik again. Embalmak is, apparently, weak to Steel. That means it's
      either Ghost/Rock or Ghost/Ice, and I think Ice is a bit more likely. It
      would go some ways to explaining why all the dialogue in Beast Tower kept
      mentioning "Mist". That is an Ice move after all.

      And now, for the tale of how Rowsdower absolutely ruined Varik's day. His
      levels are actually up to snuff this time, his ace was Level 40 which is
      actually a decent bit higher than my team, and the rest was basically on
      par.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gryphern's out first, who barely lived a Thunderbolt and hit me back with
      a Flamethrower. Pretty cool if this thing is actually Fire/Flying, seems
      pretty likely since it did pretty good damage to Rowsdower (and
      Flamethrower isn't even a TM in vanilla RBY so this move would've have
      come from that). We're sitting at 29 HP right now, so in the moment I
      don't love the chances of Rowsdower contributing much more to this battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlefinn comes in next, which Rowsdower of course also outspeeds. This
      time though, we land the Critical Hit and it goes down in one shot.
      Afterwards Canghoulit comes out, and we outspeed with Bite and land a
      second Crit in a row! Rowsdower's obviously real fast, so with Gen 1 crit
      mechanics he's gonna land them much more often than other Beasts. But
      that's still an impressive performance so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Majivich comes out next, and while we do once again outspeed a
      non-critical Bite isn't enough to take it down. Somehow though, Varik
      thought it would be smart to go for Confusion againt my Dark type. There's
      a real possibility Majivich straight up had no other attacking moves, but
      whatever the case may be we hit another Bite and Majivich goes down with
      no trouble. After getting hit by one attack on the first turn we've
      successfully taken down 4/5 of Varik's Beasts with just Rowsdower.
      Unfortunately, that streak ends with his ace, Floratress. (Which is
      apparently not an evolution of Mosston, it's an evolution of Lawncrete.
      That honestly makes a lot more sense.)
    </p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Look at that damage, though! Remember when I gave Rowsdower Hurricane?
      This was the first time I got to use it, and it got this close to actually
      soloing Varik's entire team. What a performance from Rowsdower, just
      incredible stuff. In any case, Tubi came in and finished the job with a
      Falcon Punch.

      The NPC in this room that gives you the Lapras has dialogue that seems
      pretty much unchanged from the original game, bar saying Star Beast and
      the name "Nocean" instead of Lapras. But it still ferries you across the
      water. Indeed, it's a very Lapras-esque creature.

      The second battle in our gauntlet is the bodyguard we've heard so much
      about, who's standing in front of the door to Silph's President's office.
      It's... A Cue Ball. With two level 33 Needolfs and a level 33 Slobbix. I
      mean, the Slobbix is kind of interesting, it even barely lived a Rocky Dan
      Earthquake. But I still feel pretty let down considering no fewer than
      three different NPCs hyped this guy up to me.

      This time Predatox was his lead, and I had Zorotl up. I went for Psychic,
      but evidently Predatox is Poison/Dark since it was immune. I no longer
      have moral high ground over Varik's Majivich. I tried to just go for Ice
      Beams to 1v1 it that way, but I both got poisoned by a turn 1 Sludge and
      then got a Special drop from Crunch, so Zorotl was destined to go down to
      this thing. Tubi was able to finish the job with a Flash Cannon on the
      rebound.

      Charkonro is in next, and I went for a Falcon Punch even though I knew
      this thing was a Rock type. Really I just wanted to see how much it would
      do, since every other time I've used the move it's one-shotted its target.
      It did quite a good amount of damage for being resisted, but I did learn
      the move does have an actual downside: It's a flying type Hyper Beam. I'm
      more than fine with that though, I love RBY Hyper Beam and here I get to
      have STAB on it with a type that actually beats some stuff. And I didn't
      even need to grind for Game Corner coins to get it!

      Charkonro didn't do anything to capitalize on this, just going for a Skull
      Bash. I swapped out to Rocky Dan since Flash Cannon wouldn't be neutral
      damage thanks to the type bug. In hindsight I definitely could've knocked
      it out, so I don't know why I felt the need to do this. In any case, I
      swapped out to Rocky Dan who wound up catching a Selfdestruct. It was a 4x
      resisted one though, so nothing to worry about.

      Tearwulf came in next, and I had no idea what type this thing was yet. I
      just went for a Flash Cannon, but it only took one hit of a critical hit
      Double Kick to knock Rocky Dan into next week. That's gotta be STAB with
      that amount of damage. I threw out Toby Kebel next, who unfortunately
      caught a Growl on the turn I went for Glare, so my Wraps were dealing very
      little damage. I was able to get quite a few of them off, but I wasn't
      even able to knock it down to half health before I died to two Shadow
      Claws off two Wrap misses. Rowsdower wound up cleaning up afterwards.

      Lucian's new ace is a new Beast: He's missing his Weedimp from the last
      fight, so this might be one of its evolutions that we saw alluded to
      before. Unfortunately, it anticlimatically got knocked out by one
      Rowsdower Thunderbolt. It wasn't even super effective, Rowsdower's just
      that incredible. Such a good boy, so talented.
