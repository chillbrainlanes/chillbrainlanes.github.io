    <p>
      We won't be able to make much progress through Route 11 yet due to
      (presumably) a Slobbix blocking the road, but we might as well check the
      tall grass and fight the trainers. The only new thing I found in the grass
      was Veilumber, who we saw in the gym, but the trainers did have a handful
      of new Beasts to show off.
    </p>

      Some viewers might remember that I said I would reevaluate whether I
      should teach Mr. Bungle Bubblebeam after "a couple more levels". Some
      skeptics may have thought that I simply forgot about this, and that I'd be
      stuck with Water Gun on both Beasts all the way until I got Surf. However,
      my grand plans have all come to fruition now, as Mr. Bungle learned
      Bubblebeam by level up.

      This route's also home two Engineers, who are literally the only Engineers
      in the whole game. I like their sprite here though, the missing arm adds
      some fun character.
    </p>

          got compensated if so.</i

      These two trainers have three new Beasts between them, so let's go through
      them all in order.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/shocknroll.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >i absolutely love all of these very shi kong xing shou designs that
          are really obviously just the first thing someone drew</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      As I'm sure you'll be thrilled to know, Shocknroll is <i>another</i> Steel
      type! I feel like I'm going crazy. I guess they didn't really have that
      much choice in some of these, since they did come from a different game
      originally. But they could've easily made this thing just Electric and
      been done with it. They made this next Beast non-Steel even though it
      looks like it could've been, I would've appreciated them exercising that
      kind of restraint more.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/electrio.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >this name could've also been three electabuzzes coming out of the
          ground</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The last Beast is, I think, actually the final form of Electrio going by
      its name. I initially thought it was the final evolution of Epilepsia,
      especially since it was weak to a Bite from Rowsdower, but checking the
      Stardex suggests that Convulsia is actually the final form there. Makes me
      even more glad that I took XMVSF off the team, I really dig this design
      but it wouldn't have even evolved into it. I would've just gotten my hopes
      up seeing it here.

      The last thing of note on this route is another trade, looking for a
      Slasher and offering an Inoyu. Unlike the last one, I've actually seen
      both of those Starbies, so if I ever want an Inoyu I suppose I can come
      back from this after I get the Silph Scope and can catch a Slasher.

      We don't get very far on Route 12 thanks to, indeed, Slobbix, so from here
      we've got to turn around and make for Rock Tunnel.
    </p>

      Route 9 gives us the Teleport TM. Gee, thanks. It also gives us this
      Canadian Hiker, which is at least a little more interesting.
    </p>

      Only a couple new Beasts on this Route, just from trainers. First is this
      little stinker, who my first experience with was Gen 1 Missing a
      Thunderbolt against it. A formidable foe indeed.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/malevolos.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">

      A new trainer is a Hiker that's fishing in the water just north of the
      Star Beast Center, who exists to give some hints about where to find some
      Beasts. He had a Cuppacaf on his team, and after the fight he meantions
      you can find "coffee n' slime monsters" in the water here by fishing with
      a Super Rod. This does confirm that the lady in Vermillion wasn't talking
      out of her ass when she mentioned pollution attracts slime monsters, so
      I'm glad there's still some good and helpful people in the world today.

    <p>
      Against one of the trainers on this route, I decided to actually scroll
      down to Cut in the menu for the first time, just for fun I guess. Looking
      at it is when I learned that it's apparently a Steel type move now.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/cut.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>just what this game needed, more steel</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I guess I really should've thought to check that they didn't buff the HMs,
      since that's a pretty classic ROM hack move. I wound up popping open the
      documentation for this one: Cut is 70 base power and has a 10% chance to
      paralyze the target. I guess because you like, cut a limb off? That's
      awfully grim, but that's a great move, and gives us yet another way to
      potentially spread paralysis for our Wrappers (albeit that's probably not
      going to come up very often). It's not so good that I want to teach it to
      more of my team than just Zorotl, but it's good to keep in mind either
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we're about to head into Rock Tunnel, I decided to also check
      Flash's new effect. It's now an Electric-type attack, with 60 base power
      and a 30% chance to flinch. Not a great move, but synergizes pretty well
      with our paralysis support, and literally everyone on our team can learn
      it. I was just planning on stashing someone in the box for the trip so we
      can bring XMVSF along for Flash, but it looks like that won't be
      necessary. Mr. Bungle's got a pretty free slot on his moveset right now
      that's just being occupied by Leer, so he'll get to pick up some nice
      coverage for other Water types while we're at it. This also has the
      distinct benefit of making it so I never have to look at XMVSF's
      disappointing face ever again.

      Last new critter before Rock Tunnel pretty soundly disproves my "Inozu
      evolves from Splashee" theory, but does live up to Splashee's weirdly
      incredibly good shading on its sprite. I don't love the design in a
      vacuum, but it's a good sprite.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rock Tunnel has led me to a surprising revelation: I don't think Duhzlugg
      is actually a Rock type. I assumed it was, since it looked like one and it
      was in Mt. Moon, but I think it might actually just be a pure Psychic
      type? Odd, but I guess it being a crystal almost makes sense for that?
      Bubblebeam did normal damage, Bite was super effective, and it learns
      Psywave as previously established. So that's my best guess at this
      juncture. Wild Mosstons also show up here, and one Hiker comments that
      they're "tough as hell"! Which I'm inclined to agree with, although
      luckily when they're wild they're easy to run from. As for new Starbies,
      the only wild creature we haven't seen yet looks to be a pre-evolved form
      of that coal guy we saw on the route earlier.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/charcold.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >i think the funniest possible backstory for this mon is that the
          on-fire version was in vast fame's original game, they wanted to put
          it in here, and they were like "wait i have a great idea for a
          pre-evolved form" and it was just this</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Rock Tunnel was otherwise pretty uneventful. One of the Collectors
      explained to me what Cosplay is, one of the Lasses said "My God" after she
      lost which means she's going to hell for taking the Lord's name in vain.
      Toby Kebel got hit by an Embrain's Hypnosis, slept for 5 turns, and then
      immediately got hit by another one. That trainer also had a Malevolos, and
      they were the same color, which kind of tricked me into thinking Malevolos
      was the evolved form of Embrain. It's not, after checking the Dex it's
      Kremate which makes a lot of sense in hindsight. There was also one last
      new Starbie on a trainer's team, though: the evolution of Aspiro.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real biggest news of Rock Tunnel isn't actually related to the dungeon
      itself, it's a confirmation of a mechanical oddity with this game which
      I'm not sure if it's a bug or just a really weird gameplay decision. I've
      noticed, throughout the playthrough, that sometimes moves that I thought
      would deal normal damage would instead say they were not very effective.
      Using Wing Attack on a Cromag for example, it's a Rock/Fighting type, so
      the damage should even out to being neutral. Instead, it would say it was
      not very effective. This made me doubt a lot of type matchups that I
      thought I knew pretty well (for example, Cromag I just assumed was just a
      Rock type, even though I thought I remembered Confusion being super
      effective). This has happened a good handful of times, some that I
      mentioned bit a lot more that I didn't. I was able to confirm that
      something is up here in this dungeon with two test cases: Wing Attack on
      Weedimp was not very effective even though I'm confident it's a Grass
      type, and a wild Manhandla's Mach Punch on Zorotl, who I know for a fact
      is Normal/Flying. Both of these moves were displayed as being not very
      effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this just a visual bug, or does it actually affect damage calculations?
      Honestly, I'm not sure. I think it might actually affect damage, but it's
      hard to know the damage these moves actually would've done in a lot of
      cases since I don't know the stats on these critters. I'll have to see if
      I can find a place to test this. I'm guessing this is a bug, since it
      would be a very odd thing to want to change on purpose, but maybe these
      devs just have some very odd ideas about balancing? Or maybe it's a
      reference to Shi Kong Xing Shou, who knows. In any case, it's something
      I'll have to keep in mind going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of this dungeon, I was really feeling the Wrap PP blues. Wrap
      is great for cheesing strong battles, but it's really bad for dungeons
      since you have to use so many of them to get anything done, and a larger
      sample size of fights gives your opponents more chances to win the miss
      chances and get potshots on you. The good news is there's not actually a
      ton of capital d Dungeons left in the game, especially not with a bunch of
      wild encounters that make it annoying to leave and heal your PP. There's
      one bright spot at the end of the tunnel though, since I found a wild
      Inoyu.

      Doubt I'll actually use this thing, but it was pretty scary in the gym
      fight, and I hate to say it but Mr. Bungle might wind up getting cut from
      the team if the Ground weakness becomes too much of a liability.

      This might be the only RBY overworld sprite I've ever seen with an
      identifiable mouth. Oh, and if you guessed this dude said "Mon" a lot,
      you'd be correct. Apparently he's raising two of these "yetis" because
      they're an endangered species, but he wants to give one of them away to an
      experienced trainer. He sees that we beat Eleksi (maybe he knows them
      because they've worked together in the past? who's to say) and offers to
      give us a yeti. And who am I to say no to a free yeti.

      I've noticed this is the second Ice type that we've seen as a gift Star
      Beast and not in the wild. I wonder if they had a lot of Ice types they
      wanted to include in the game, but wanted some of them to be available
      before the Seafoam Islands which is really the only Ice-themed area in
      RBY. Although I guess Bladeberus probably wanted to be special for other
      reasons.
