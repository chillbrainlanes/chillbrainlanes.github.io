    <p class="centertext bigtext">Episode 1: Disco Volante</p>
    <p>
      The Gospel of John begins with one of the most famous biblical passages:
      "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
      was God." Star Beasts: Asteroid Version is basically the same thing,
      except instead of the Word there's a ghost and a little spiky dude, and
      instead of God there's Wacky Workbench "P" mix from Sonic CD (JP/EU OST).

      Not really sure what's up with the music choice, but it's only a very
      small clip of the song before we transition to the main title screen. The
      animation plays out basically the same as the classic Nidorino and Gengar
      one. Here we also get out first look at the Super Game Boy border for this
      game. It looks good! I honestly was not expecting an SGB border so this
      was a pleasant surprise. We've got an amusing selection of critters here:
      They look suspiciously Grass, Fire, and Water themed, so my guess would be
      that these are our starters.
    </p>

      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/title.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The title screen is exactly what you'd expect in terms of format: Our
      protagonist and a cycling display of various creatures. But how
      <i>about</i> that protagonist! What a great sprite and character design.
      It doesn't feel like a Pokémon protagonist design, it feels like someone
      else trying to make a protagonist for "Pokémon but cooler", which is so
      perfect for this kind of game. They've definitely got some very modern day
      feeling androgynous swag, which is arguably a bit anachronistic if this is
      trying to feel like an old bootleg. But I think it works out alright. Plus
      it means the devs didn't have to worry about programming in two different
      hero designs to cover different gender options. Work smarter, not harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to avoid waiting for the demo reel to cycle through all the new
      critters since I would rather see them in context, but the one shown here
      did briefly catch my eye before I pressed Start. This dragon lookin' dude
      rocking the fuck out on the drums. Look at them they're so happy! Look at
      the little music notes!! I really hope I can use this thing on my team,
      I'm already a big fan. Oh, and the music here is the title theme from the
      Pokémon Trading Card Game game for Game Boy Color: Definitely a fitting
      and catchy track although not exactly an inspired choice.

      Professor Cherry is the name of our guide through the introduction. Her
      dialogue has a much more bubbly feel than Oak's did, but the beats she
      covers are more or less the same. Of course, this world is populated by
      mysterious creatures called Star Beasts, not Pokémon. She clarified that
      "most people just call them Starbies", which is handy because "Beasts" is
      kind of hard to say really fast. The one she shows you here is the same
      spikey fellow from the intro, which checks out.

      The name options for our protagonist are all appropriately space-themed.
      Which is cute, but it does make me wonder if there's any lore behind Star
      Beasts actually coming from space in this game. Maybe the museum in Pewter
      City will have something about this? Guess we'll see. For now, I decided
      to just go with Stella, since it was the first option and felt like a good
      name. And I'm glad I did too, because I'm fairly certain this bit is
      exclusive to you selecting Stella as a name:

      Good lord, what a pull. Apparently this is what Cherry learned my full
      name was, but "That's. That's a lot.", so she's just going to call me
      Stella. This is likely completely inscrutable to most viewers here, but I
      do actually happen to know what this is a reference to: It's this decade
      old YouTube video about a man on a couch reviewing a toy violin, with some
      delightfully horrible translation on its packaging. (And the Angry Birds
      theme). It's a great video, but this absolute non sequitur gag in the
      first minute of gameplay really caught me off guard. This is so
      delightfully ROM hack. I didn't exactly find this funny, but it did make
      me very confident that I chose the right game to play for this. This is
      gonna make for great TV.

      Here's the timestamped clip, incidentally.<br />

      Our rival name is only slightly less eventful. Rather than forgetting his
      name, Cherry asks "What name is he going by now?" which implies some
      exciting things about this dude. The real money is in the middle of the
      three name options here.

    <p>
      Varik is the name of the protagonist of 1991 PC-98/FM Towns RPG
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandish_(video_game)">Brandish</a
      >. More relevantly, that character's name and design were repurposed for
      the main character in Toby Fox's infamous "EarthBound Halloween Hack".
      That hack is most well known for being the origin of Megalovania, but it's
      also pretty widely known to have some... questionable content of its own.
      I am unshakably certain that this is why the name is an option here. In
      the vain hope that choosing it will trigger exclusive dialogue of an NPC
      calling me the F-slur, I went with Varik for the rival's name.
    </p>

      With that, the journey begins. The player's room is pretty much unchanged
      from the original, the only different flavor text I could find was
      "Pokémon books" being replaced by "Star Beast books". In general, if I
      ever don't mention text as being different, assume it's the same except
      with "Pokémon" replaced by "Star Beast" or "Starbie". I was really hoping
      the game console would be something different, to be honest. Still just a
      SNES here, though.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The only actual gameplay element in this room, the PC, actually does have
      a change that sticks out though: In addition to giving you a Potion, it
      also gives you an Antidote. This bodes... ill. Feels like the kind of
      thing they had to add in playtesting due to something being really
      obnoxious with poison. Guess we'll see.

      Our mom continues to leave our gender vague. Whether this is a
      "purposefully ambiguous so you can project onto them" situation or a "this
      character is strictly nonbinary" one is not something I'm sure we'll ever
      learn definitively in-game. All three suggested names definitely have a
      more feminine feel than a masculine one, but the space theme also makes
      them all believable as names most of the NB people I know would think were
      cool.

      Well if there was ever any doubt about the Varik thing before, the TV's
      flavor text reading "A child is attacking a skeleton wearing a blue
      jacket. Where have I seen this before?" pretty much seals it. Kind of
      crazy that the film adaptation of Undertale in this setting is the
      Genocide route and not True Pacifist. Idk, maybe it's a spinoff show or a
      special or something. Does seem like the kind of episode they'd air reruns
      of a lot either way, so it airing right now checks out. It was also at
      this point that I decided to go and check the settings to turn up the text
      speed, and was met with a very amusing setting: There's an option for
      "Difficulty" but the only option is "Yes". So I guess this playthrough
      will be played on Yes Difficulty.

      Pallet Town is about the same as ever. I don't recognize the music here,
      but it's quite pleasant. The "Technology is incredible!" guy is here and
      accounted for, and lets you know that this game has a Run button,
      certainly a welcome feature. The one other outdoor NPC of real note is
      this lady, who asks if we found our "lost dog". I do happen to know that,
      in the original Shi Kong Xing Shou, your dog is transformed into a Star
      Beast and becomes your starter, so that may be what this is referencing?
      Maybe these fellows on the SGB border aren't the starters after all.

      Rather than a sister, our rival has an actual parental figure, although he
      doesn't say much of interest. The big draw here is the map on his wall,
      which confirms that the world is mostly just the familiar Kanto region,
      although with a couple additions. I tried not to really pore over every
      special area so as to preserve some surprise, but I did catch a glimpse of
      a couple names that got me pretty excited.

      Before long, we step out into the grass and are stopped by the Starbie
      Prof herself. They did do a good job with her dialogue, it's the same
      broad strokes as Oak but she feels much younger and more energetic. She
      also says "geez" like two or three times throughout the whole next series
      of cutscenes, which is pretty amusing. Here in the lab, we've got our
      choice of three Star Balls, just as you'd expect. I guess our dog will
      stay lost for now.
    </p>
    <p>Our options are...</p>

      The name here is pretty amusing, and all but confirms this is a creature
      from the original game. I don't know why you'd name this Quincy if not for
      it being a literal translation.

      This is the one of the most "this was made for a Pokémon-like game by
      someone who didn't really get Pokémon's design sensibilities" designs I've
      ever seen. Leads me to beleive all three of these starters come from Shi
      Kong Xing Shou, which makes sense since the original creatures didn't come
      until later in the project's life.

      Poor guy! How could you poach such a polite looking fellow. I decided to
      choose Jelleye, I think they've got a winner's spirit and a positive
      attitude which are essential for winning battles.

    <p>
      Full transparency, I'm writing this all up two days after I played through
      this segment of the game. With that in mind, I have genuinely zero
      recollection of how my brain led me to name this creature after American
      experimental rock group Mr. Bungle. But that's what I did. So welcome to
      the team, Mr. Bungle!
    </p>
    <p>
      Funnily, Varik goes out of his way to choose the starter that beats ours
      here, so we know he's canonically a tryhard. Important characterization!
      Then we're off into our first battle.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/lv5moveset.png" />

      Our starting move set perhaps gives away why that Antidote was in the PC
      at the beginning of the game: The rival battle being able to Poison you
      sounds kind of miserable. But we have that on our side this time, and it
      gives us a super-effective move against Quincy. Lot of good that type
      matchup is doing you now, buster!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this did not work nearly as well in practice. Poison Sting
      has a measly 15 base power, so even when doubled due to the weakness it's
      only dealing 30 base power: Less than our opponent's Pound. Quincy also
      starts with Harden, which makes our Stings even more flaccid. Even when
      landing two(!!) critical hits, we still had to use the Potion to win the
      match, but win it we did. And our reward for reaching Level 6 could not
      have made me more excited.

      At this point I was begging and pleading on my knees. Please please
      <i>please</i> let this game have unmodified RBY Wrap mechanics. I'll spoil
      for you now: It does, and I'm absolutely thrilled. Wrap is so funny in
      RBY, and the computer opponents aren't gonna get annoyed at me wasting
      their time like OU ladder players, so this is the perfect chance to use
      it. I'm not sure how fast Mr. Bungle is, but if I can build some paralysis
      support into this team and find a couple more Wrap users, we might just be
      off to the races.
