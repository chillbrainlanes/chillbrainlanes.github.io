      Episode 8: A Little Guy That Lives In a Blue World
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright, time to get ourselves a Surfin Badge. After a brief pep talk from
      the Gym Guide who tells us it's "totally radical", we've got a Swimmer and
      a Jr. Trainer to take down before the boss.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/swimmer.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>damn they gave him hair okay pop off</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This Swimmer had an Infestin, who I'm pretty sure actually isn't a water
      type since Thundershock wasn't super effective. It's definitely Bug, since
      Rock Throw was super effective, so I'm not sure. When I fight some more of
      them I might try and check.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/jrtrainer.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >so it is a female camper sprite, but the gen 3 one instead of the gen
          4 one. i'm still counting that as roughly a matching pair.</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The Jr. Trainer put up much more of a fight, with a Level 19 Jellyelly.
      Rowsdower's Super Fang is starting to really get some use now, against
      Starbies this bulky. Sure, it was still a three hit KO either way, but
      Super Fang and 2 Thundershocks is so much cooler than just using
      Thundershock 3 times. So consider that.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/mizu.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >i feel like this sprite is also based on something i've seen before
          but i can't put my finger on it. maybe it's just a surfer sprite from
          some gen 2 or 3 game.</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Mizu's gimmick is that she's a surfer. Gym leaders in these games only get
      like 4 lines of dialogue total so that's the best you're gonna get. You're
      not here for rich characterization, you're here to see some little
      monsters. Case in point:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/splashee.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>splashee, meaning one who is splashed</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This sprite actually looks so good, the shading and stuff is so dynamic.
      It immediately landed a Sing on Rowsdower and got a 6-turn sleep, but I
      wasn't even that upset because I really liked looking at it. (I also got
      to listen to the Club Leader battle theme the whole time and I think I get
      less mad when I'm listening to that song. So maybe it was actually a
      genius decision.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowsdower was able to power through and wake up with the help of Splashee
      using a bunch of useless Mist, but he still had quite low HP so fell
      easily to a Bubblebeam from the next Starbie up.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/inoyu.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >if star beasts had a competitive metagame do you think inoyu would be
          in ou</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Another great sprite, I assume from context this is Splashee's evolved
      form. It's got Powder Snow, which is kind of novel and would be real bad
      news if I was planning on countering this gym with a Grass type. If I
      can't use my Electric type though (and since XMVSF is warming the bench
      right now) we're going with the Wrap brigade on this one. The Peeker's
      Wrap, as ever, does quite low damage, so I needed some paralysis support
      from Toby Kebel to take this thing down. What I didn't expect was, after
      the Glare and getting a full paralysis afterwards, Toby Kebel just soloed
      the whole fight with Wrap and Inoyu never got to take another action. I
      need to stop doubting my GOAT.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/goatcoversation.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Despite functionally carrying the team, Toby Kebel was not the biggest
      benefactor of this gym victory. The Peeker, who barely contributed in the
      fight but did get swapped in at one point, score a Level Up off that
      experience. Which led to...
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/peekerevolution.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>the peeker has evolved into sharethis</i>

        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Gun to my head, I would start crying, as previously mentioned. But if you
      asked me what The Peeker was going to evolve into, even having seen
      Deathseer I never would've guessed they were related. My hands turned into
      a dog! This game's got so many dogs and now my hands are one of them! I'm
      not even upset it's just a bit odd. On evolution it also learned Shadow
      Claw, which I taught over Scratch.
    </p>

          with but i couldn't think of anything that worked well. sorry
          everyone</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Alongside our badge we're also given the TM for Bubblebeam, which is
      another one that I'm a bit stumped on who I'll want to give it to. Mr.
      Bungle is an obvious choice, since it would be replacing Water Gun as a
      much more powerful STAB move, but I've also got a feeling he's going to
      learn a better water move by leveling up in not too long, and long-term
      he'll get access to Surf for sure. Toby Kebel, on the other hand, has been
      getting some good use out of Water Gun and might never get a chance to
      upgrade his Water coverage if I don't use this TM here. I think I'll wait
      a bit until we get some more levels to see if Mr. Bungle gets some better
      Water STAB, then I'll make the decision maybe after the 3rd gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other TM news, with that spectacular performance by Toby Kebel I
      decided I really did want to give Thunder Wave to one of my Wrap users,
      since that combination is just so deadly. I was planning on teaching it to
      Mr Bungle here, but on inspection, while it couldn't learn it as a
      Manhandla, The Peeker as a Deathseer actually can learn Thunder Wave. I
      waffled a bit on who should get it, but I think Mr. Bungle is probably
      going to wind up with better defensive stats by the late game than The
      Peeker, especially since Deathseer is the final evolution going by Stardex
      order, so Mr. Bungle needs the safety net a bit less. Plus, there's some
      novelty in The Peeker having it, even if it meant getting rid of Karate
      Chop which is a very funny visual to imagine this dog doing. Sorry Bungle,
      I know I just denied two good TMs from you, but I promise there's a good
      reason for both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last order of business here in the city is to run the Dig bandit out
      of town. He did show us one new Starbie for our troubles, which looks to
      be the evolved form of Rumpel. It isn't named Stiltzkin though, so I guess
      I'm out 20 dollars. All it had to attack was Confusion, so it put up no
      fight against a Dark type.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/majivich.png" />

    <p>
      In one of the more understatedly funny things to happen in RBY, the guy
      who was robbed and was upset about how much money he lost on having the
      Dig TM stolen doesn't even want it back when we recover it for him, since
      he just teached a Starbie named Cracture to use Dig without the TM. He
      couldn't done that the whole time, I guess. Just goes to show you,
      sometimes a tragedy is an opportunity. The next time you get robbed, just
      pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

      With the day saved, I had to go check whether the Secret Garden was open
      now. The werewolf guy was still in there, but I guess he wasn't the weirdo
      in question, because the cop was gone and I was free to head on in.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/gardeninterior.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >is it supposed to be snowy do you think, or does it just kinda look
          like that</i

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      It was at this point, dear reader, that I realized what the music playing
      in this area was. It's, I kid you not, a chiptune arrangement of Blue (Da
      Ba Dee) by Eiffel 65. I mean, I guess it's just north of Cerulean City. So
      if you lived in Cerulean when this song was big you probably wouldn't hear
      the end of it. But it still really caught me off guard. You know what
      though? It's a lot more interesting than another TCG GBC tune, so I'll
      take it. Bring on the weird shit, that's what I'm here for.
    </p>
    <p>
      After poking around in the grass for a bit, I didn't find anything too
      exciting, mostly a lot of Manhandlas. There's an NPC in here standing in
      front of a house, who says they come here to meditate. Did Bill let them
      in to do that? It doesn't seem like there's usually any security for this
      place beyond the cop who left after the robbery was solved. Unless the
      werewolf guy is supposed to be the security, but he thought I was a
      morally evil person and he still let me through, so who knows. The real
      main attraction of this secret garden is an overworld encounter, and as
      the dialogue before its fight says, it's "supposed to be pretty rare..."

      It's an Eevee horse! I'll bet you anything that's what this actually is,
      it's gonna have a bunch of item-evolving forms and everything. If that is
      what this is, then it should actually fit onto our team very well: We've
      got kind of an awkward selection of types right now, and I imagine we're
      going to continue swapping out team members at least a couple more times.
      If I just raise this horse alongside the rest of my team, once I have a
      final composition I can just evolve it into whatever form helps fill the
      gaps we have the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm getting ahead of myself though, I don't even know for sure that's what
      this Beast's whole deal is. All I know is it's doing pretty huge damage
      with Horn Attack, so I might want it on my team over XMVSF just for that.
      Let's just catch it and we'll figure it out from there.

      Oh yeah baby, called it. Everyone please type "Wow Chill, you're so cool
      and talented and attractive" in the comments to shower me with praise for
      my superior deductive reasoning skills. We caught this little fellow in
      the secret garden of Eiffel 65, so there's only one nickname that makes
      sense to me. Welcome to the team
      <a href="https://www.zorotl.com/">Zorotl!</a>
    </p>
    <p>Anyways, time to leave- AHHHHHH!!!!!!</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/pumajin.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>AAAAA WHAT IS THAT IT'S SCARY!!!!!!!!</i>

    <p>
      I had to run away as fast as I could, that thing was so scary. It jumped
      me in the tall grass as I was trying to leave and it was the most
      harrowing experience of my life. I'm sure all you chumps are gonna laugh
      it up but just think if you were in my shoes. If you saw an evil fire
      tiger coming out of a little hole thing you would be scared too.
    </p>
    <p>
      After taking a moment to collect myself, I return to Cerulean to grab
      Zorotl out of the PC. It's a Normal/Flying type, and its moveset currently
      consists of just Horn Attack and Wing Attack. I imagine the only other
      moves it learns will be Hoof Attack, Tail Attack, Large Intestine Attack
      and etc. In any case, having a Flying type on the team is really fortunate
      for us: Currently we have two Poison types, an Electric type (previously
      two), a Rock/Steel type, and even The Peeker is using Thunder Wave to
      enable its main cheese tactic. We are <i>comically</i> weak to Ground, so
      having something that can come in on an Earthquake or something if need be
      is going to be very helpful. I imagine this means we'll be going with the
      Water type form, assuming its evolutions are the same types as Eevee's.
      This has the added benefit of probably making Zorotl actually Blue, which
      is like his one character trait. Oh, and I did try the Moon Stone to see
      if it worked and it didn't, so we'll have to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, southwards to Route 5! In which we encounter this little
      fella
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Beyond just looking very helpful and polite, Plugenploy also starts with
      Thunder Wave! I don't think it's going to be making the team, but it is an
      Electric/Grass type which could help the Ground problem, and the more
      potential paralysis support I can have in reserve the better, so I'll
      throw it in the box for now.
    </p>

      Also on this route is one other new Starbie, which I had no reason to want
      to capture but still wanted to share with everybody out of the goodness of
      my heart.

      The gate to Saffron City is blocked for a slightly more sensible reason
      here: We can't be let through because of "criminal activity", although he
      does remark that "it would be nice if we got something to drink..." I
      appreciate that the solution to the "puzzle" is the same as before, but
      it's a little bit less arbitrary. It's the kind of thing that feels like
      it would fit in the vanilla game too, since obviuosly Team Rocket has a
      big presence there thanks to Silph Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the gate for the Underground Path is an in-game trade, just like in
      the vanilla game, but this one continues the Starter trades from Cerulean
      City. She's asking for a fully evolved Velociflea though, so not something
      it would be easy for me to grab unfortunately. So I grab my hidden Full
      Restore and head on my way.

      This game is really starting to pick up in ROM hack bullshit now, and I am
      amped for it. The couple who are having the "private conversation" are
      still here, but when we eavesdrop on them we can see they're talking
      indecipherable gibberish.
    </p>
    <figure>

    <p>
      The NPC at the end of the route provides additional commentary on these
      two, asking "You're not one of those cult members, are you?" and adding
      after the battle that "Those NEPUTAIL fan club guys freak me out..." In
      context, with it being called a "fan club" here it's pretty easy to
      interpret the "cult member" bit as this guy just mocking them for behaving
      weirdly. But considering the gibberish text (and some paranthetical
      narration saying explicitly that the player can't understand what they're
      saying), I'm pretty inclined to take this at face value. We'll definitely
      learn more about this later, with this name drop of "Neputail" and
      ("NepuBadge" being one of the badge names we saw earlier).

    <p>
      So, cult! This is like, the Platonic ideal of ROM hack nonsense. Some real
      Snakewood shit. I mean no offense when I say that the person who made this
      game either is a teenager or is spiritually one. And that's the ideal
      mindset to have when you're making a ROM hack, to me. This shit rocks. I
      am loving every second of this game.

      Fighting through the trainers on this route has really proven to me just
      how incredibly powerful Zorotl is. STAB Horn Attack is a pretty great move
      for this point in the game, and he's got incredibly solid stats to back it
      up: Even a super-effective Thundershock from an enemy would've only been a
      3-hit-KO. Other than things that resist it, it's been able to consistently
      two-hit or even one-hit KO the enemies here with Horn Attack, and I'm even
      below them in level. Here's one of the things that did resist Horn Attack
      though: It looks like the evolution of Scorpsy, who I'm fairly certain was
      Bug/Poison, so I'm not sure what this is beyond "probably Steel, I guess".
