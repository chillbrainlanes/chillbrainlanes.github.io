      Episode 10: There's A Guy Called "Weedimp" In This One
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I head to the Gym, I should go poke around Vermillion City and talk
      to the NPCs that I didn't check out when I first arrived. I should also
      point out that the music for Vermillion City is actually like, a more
      smooth chill redition of the Saffron City theme. Kind of odd, but I guess
      goes along with Viridian's music also being a rearrangement of a different
      track.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trade for DUX completes the starter trades with a Kindergard for a
      Jelleye. I did actually catch a Kindergard, but this is the one starter I
      don't need. Oh well. Outside in the middle of the town is the woman who
      comments about pollution. In the vanilla game, she says that they're
      careful because Grimer populates in polluted water, but here she still
      says something similar, saying that it attracts "slime monsters". Are
      there any Grimer-esque slimes in the game, I wonder? I suppose Slimogg is
      kind of close, but people actually like them.

      A man in the Star Beast Center mentions that Needolf has a split
      evolution: It can evolve with either a Moon Stone or an item called the
      "Dark Soul". I was under the impression that the Souls were the
      equivalents of Fossils, but maybe they're actually a more important
      worldbuilding thing and they have a lot of different properties. Or maybe
      none of this matters.

      In the Star Beast Fan Club, I grab the Bike Voucher after hearing how
      president hugs his "Kremate" every night, and how his "Gryphern" will fly
      him anywhere. Importantly though, one of the NPCs does give us a glimpse
      at a Starbie we very well may be adding to our team at some point.

      Alright, time to take on Eleksi. Evidently she's a world famous singer,
      and she sets up the trash can puzzle as a security system in case her fans
      get too rowdy. There was a guy on the dock outside who said he called off
      work for a week to see her perform, but she was "on the fritz again", so
      maybe we'll learn the deal with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first trainer is, hilariously a Rocket who's got the Rochet battle
      theme and everything. (I don't think I ever mentioned this, but yeah the
      Rockets all have the GSC Rocket battle theme). He says he's afraid that
      I'll tell "the boss" that he's shirking his duties in here, but I still
      don't even know if Giovanni is the boss or not, so I think you're safe for
      now, guy. He did have one of these things though.

      It stood no chance against The Peeker's Wraps, but the Needolf that came
      in afterwards dodged 3 Wraps in a row and kicked The Peeker's ass. That's
      rough. Luckily Toby Kebel could come in and pick up the slack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems like this gym's trainers don't actually use Electric type Beasts,
      since they're all just fans who are here to see the show. This trend
      continues with a Cue Ball, who says she wants Eleksi to autograph his
      head. I love the Cue Balls, they're probably my favorite trianer type.
      Mostly just because I think calling a bald person a "cue ball" is
      hilarious. 10/10 localization.

    <p>
      The big bald boy gets a chance to show us what the Fan Club President's
      favorite Starbie actually looks like, since he's got a Kremate on his
      team. I can't say I'd want to hug it while sleeping myself, but I'm not
      gonna hate. The man gave me a free bicycle, I'm in no place to judge his
      lifestyle behind his back.

      What can I even say about this thing. It's perfect. It's Grass/Steel
      though, and boy, this game sure loves its Steel types. It makes the Wrap
      strategy kind of inconvenient sometimes, to be honest. But we'll power
      through.

    <p>Our last opponent before the Gym Leader is a Gambler, who has...</p>

    <p>
      Don't misinterpret what I'm saying here as me saying I don't love Rocky
      Dan just the way he is. I wouldn't trade him for the world. But Rollen?
      Rollen has captured my heart from the minute I opened this game for the
      first time. I'll miss you, buddy. (It clicked Meditate and then
      Selfdestruct, lol)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we just have to complete the best puzzle in Pokémon history before we
      can fight the boss. In case you didn't know, this puzzle is actually
      slightly bugged in RBY: The second switch could be in one of the adjacent
      trash cans like it's supposed to be, but it also always has a random
      chance of being in the top left can. The first time I found the first
      switch, I just dropped a save state to save time and tried all the
      adjacent cans. The switch was in none of them. Turns out, I got the
      glitch. Pretty funny.
    </p>
    <p>Anyways Eleksi is a robot.</p>

      The full quote here is: "You hear an odd whirring noise as Alexi turns
      towards you. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. YOU ARE A: TRUE FAN. SHOCKING, FLASHY.
      THAT'S. ELESKI. NOW YOU WILL. DEFEAT. LET'S. LET'S. LET'S. You gotta hold
      onto your dream… If you wanna be a pop star!" Notice how the narration
      here isn't in parentheses, so anyone who's still holding onto that bet
      from earlier, keep waiting.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/eleksibattle.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>you know what? i never would've known just by looking at her</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Her first Starbie out is the evolved form of Epilepsia, who you may
      remember as being X-Men Versus Street Fighter from earlier in the
      playthrough. In this battle, my decision to cut that wingnut from the team
      is reaffirmed. Take a look at this.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/convulsia.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>super effective my ass</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      That's one Horn Attack from Zorotl versus one Thundershock from Convulsia.
      Not only did I outspeed and do over half, but even a STAB super-effective
      move from an evolved Starbie at almost the same level didn't even do half
      in return. Maybe this is just Zorotl being cracked rather than Convulsia
      jobbing, but either way, I want this little asshole out of my sight. Bring
      on the next Star Beast!
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/odiazolt.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>i like its little pose</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Probably the evolved form of Joltybara, and it did a shockingly bad job at
      dealing with Zorotl as well. Even while damaged, Zorotl was able to 1v1
      another evolved Electric type. Now, it did go down to a Thunderbolt from
      Eleksi's final Beast, but I think that's still a pretty stellar
      performance from a Starbie I was kind of expecting to not accomplish much
      in this fight. And like, look at this thing.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/kurayami.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>does it not have hind legs that's kind of awesome if so</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Level 27, using a whole-ass Thunderbolt, and it seems like this is the
      final evolution of Zapodi so it's definitely got a monster BST. This thing
      fully one-shot Toby Kebel who I brought in next, so I needed to really
      come up with a plan. I wound up going into Rowsdower and, for the first
      time since it was on its moveset all the way back at the start of the
      game, I used Screech. I also got a Super Fang off before I died to a Night
      Shade, so this was perfectly softened up for The Peeker to come in. It
      lived a Thunderbolt, landed a Wrap, and then finished the job with a
      super-effective Mach Punch. Done deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After claiming the Magnet Badge and the TM for Thunderbolt(!!!), we get
      some more narration after Eleksi says she's going to DISPENSE an
      AUTOGRAPH. A blank piece of paper comes out of her mouth, and we decide to
      throw it away. Lucky, since this place is filled with trash cans. And no,
      that narration was not in parentheses either.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Red and Blue, all of the TMs given out by Gym Leaders are not learned
      as level-up moves by anybody. I do already know this isn't true in Star
      Beasts, since we saw somebody with Psywave back in Mt. Moon (unless
      Psywave is no longer that gym's TM, which is also plausible). However,
      currently nobody else on my team can learn Thunderbolt anyways, it's not a
      guarantee that he'll get it by leveling up, and it's also just a
      substantial boost in firepower, so I decided to give Rowsdower Thunderbolt
      right from the jump. While I was in the business of giving Rowsdower
      upgrades, I did go and check to make sure the Moon Stone wasn't used to
      evolve him into Kurayami. Since it wasn't that much higer level than
      Rowsdower, I assume that this is some sort of special evolution like a
      Stone. And it isn't long before we're able to confirm this.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my way out of town, I decided to swing by the Mart to pick up some
      healing items and balls, and realized I never talked to the NPCs in here.
      For one of them in particular, I'm very glad I did: She lets slip that
      Eleksi got her "special Beast" by using a Dark Soul on a Shochran.
      Something something The Final Sacrifice, something something Scholar of
      the First Sin.

      Diglett's Cave has become "Cracture Chasm", and a gentleman outside the
      cave says there was a shockwave, and some things moved around inside. But
      you're here to see what a Cracture is, right? Well, here you go.

    <p>
      Cracture is yet another Steel type, and unsurprisingly has Dig. These made
      up most of the encounters I found in the chasm, but there was actually one
      other Beast I ran into.

      Level 30! That's crazy! I probably wasn't going to use this thing on my
      team, but I decided to catch it anyways just for posterity, since it was
      such a high level. Maybe if there's a boss I'm struggling with I can bring
      this thing out of the box.

      Inside, the layout was mostly the same, but there was one important extra
      area. I won't be able to do anything here right away, but once I have Surf
      and Strength I'll have to return and see what this is all about.

      On the other side are the usual suspects: I grab the Flash HM from
      Cherry's Aide, an HP Up, and another Moon Stone. The Mr. Mime trade has
      been replaced by trade of a "Swiftile" for an "Owai". I don't know what
      either of those are yet, but I suppose I'll file that info away for later.
