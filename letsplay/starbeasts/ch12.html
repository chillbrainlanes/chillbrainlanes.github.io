    <p>
      <b>MILDLY EMBARASSING PROGRAMMING NOTE:</b> The bug I talked about a bunch
      in the last episode is, I've been informed, a vanilla RBY bug. Not sure
      why I never knew about this before since I've done multiple full
      playthroughs of Gen 1, maybe I just never paid attention since I knew the
      types of everything already, maybe the way the types are distributed just
      made the bug come up less, probably a combination of both. Either way,
      it's just a visual bug and doesn't affect gameplay, but for the rest of
      the series I'm going to talk like I think it does. Not sure why I didn't
      assume it wasn't a bug from the vanilla game in the first place, to be
      honest, but I figured I should let you all know either way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavender Town is the only place in the game that I've seen so far that
      keeps its original overworld music. I suppose that's fair, it's pretty
      iconic to the Lavender Town experience. It even plays in the Star Beast
      Center and Mart here.
    </p>

      The NPCs talk about similar stuff to what you'd expect for Lavender Town.
      "Hand on your shoulder" girl is still around, Mr. Fuji's place is still
      here, you know the deal. There's one real big time NPC to talk to though,
      and that's this unassuming looking man in the Star Beast Center, who lets
      us know that the Mart here happens to sell Souls that let certain Beasts
      evolve.
    </p>

      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/sellsouls.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

      That sounds to me like a one-way ticket to evolving Rowsdower. Indeed, the
      mart does stock Dark Souls, as well as another item called the Holy Soul.
      I decided to buy one of each, the Dark Soul for obvious reasons, and the
      Holy Soul just to check it won't let us evolve any of our team. It won't,
      but I'd bet we can use it on whatever we revive from that Angel Soul
      fossil. Double up on souls. For now though, the Dark Soul is the star of
      the show.

      Rowsdower was already incredibly powerful, Super Fang was a great tool to
      have and Thunderbolt two-shot most things it had to go up against, plus
      Dark let it hit most things at least neutrally with STAB. With this BST
      bump I think it probably puts him over Rocky Dan as the most powerful
      member of the team. Pretty wild to think about.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I'm just a huge fan of this whole line in general. Love the designs and I
      love the flavor progression of "little dog that eats batteries" to
      "monster that consumes all light". That also makes the Dark typing make a
      lot more sense, lol.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're not going to be able to finish <s>Pokémon</s> Beast Tower right now
      since we don't have the Silph Scope yet, but we might as well fight all
      the trainers to get some experience. Inside there's a new tileset, and an
      NPC on the first floor mentions her deceased "Sabrantis", so there's
      another name to note down. There's also another fight against Varik here,
      and he's acting awfully gloomy.

    <p>
      For his first Beast out I was expecting to see Tomaroc again, but instead
      we've got what's probably the final form of Roc. Level 25 for that would
      be a bit surprising though, maybe he just swapped it out for a different
      Flying type. Or maybe we sent that bird to hell back on the S.S. Anne and
      that's why he's so mopey.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Gryphern here was actually a real pain in the rear, it kept Sand Attacking
      every turn, which made Wrap not especially viable, so I just swapped
      around until it used something else, and then took it down with the last
      Beast that was in when that happened. He also added a couple more Beasts
      to his team. The first one here is definitely not Litwick. This little
      stinker had both Minimize and Smokescreen. Nice evasion team bud.
    </p>

      And the second is almost certainly the evolution of Sillish, who put up a
      lot more of a fight. The Peeker was able to get a Thunder Wave off, but
      immediately afterwards got poisoned by a Poison Fang. Poison is really
      good at countering Wrap, so Toby Kebel had to come in and finish the Wrap
      job. Even then, Harlefinn was able to land a 5-hot Doubleslap that did
      half of Toby's health. Those unevolved stats are really starting to come
      back and bite him, hopefully he evolves soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuing a theme from his previous battle, Varik's levels seem very low
      here. His Majivish is only level 20, and his highest level Beast is
      Lawncrete who's 25. This feels like a mistake more than an intentional
      design choice, to be honest, especially considering the last gym leader a
      whole ass dungeon ago had a Level 27 ace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right at the end of this battle, we get two big updates to the team.
      First, The Peeker learned Crunch, which I taught over Shadow Claw. With
      that, I think The Peeker's moveset is pretty much complete for the rest of
      the game: Crunch, Wrap, Thunder Wave, and Mach Punch. I'm glad Mach Punch
      has been actually useful, since it's funny to have one holdover move from
      back when The Peeker was hands and not a dog. More importantly though, my
      wish for Toby Kebel came true much sooner than I was expecting.

    </figure>
    <p>
      As was foretold by the first time I laid eyes on Drakelet and thought
      "that name sounds a lot like a Dragon type", Ardyhydra is Dragon/Poison,
      and has some pretty solid stats to boot. At the same time, it learned
      Dragonbreath, which I decided to teach over Poison Fang: Toby's primary
      purpose is Paralysis-Wrapping, and Poison isn't a great offensive type
      even with STAB. Bubblebeam is too important for coverage against Rocks, so
      I decided to just rock with a single STAB move. According to the Stardex,
      this is Drakelet's final evolution, which is a little disappointing but I
      think we'll be fine.

      Well, celebration time's over, Varik's gonna talk about his dead parents
      now. There actually is unique sad music for this dialogue, which is a nice
      tough. He caught a Ghost in the tower, but it reminded him of his parents
      and he got sad. He tells me to tell my mom I love her. I will try to do
      this whenever I'm back in Pallet Town, but I'm not confident there's going
      to be unique dialogue for it.

    <p>
      The rest of Beast Tower is ghosts and Channelers as ever. The Ghosts look
      like this:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/ghost.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">

          not</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>And the Channelers look like this:</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/channeler.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>the original sprites in this game have never disappointed</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The Channelers, being possessed, have new dialogue that has that ROM hack
      charm. "COME WITH ME TO HELLLLLL!", "Kill….. Must…… KILL!". "This place….
      Will be your GRAVE!", they're just playing the hits really. Some of them
      are at least funny though, like this NPC who has, tragically, forgotten
      what pizza is. Or perhaps never knew at all. I feel at least equally bad
      for this Channeler as I do for Varik.
    </p>
    <figure>

      <figcaption class="centertext">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The one who just says "Zombies!" is still here, thank goodness, as is the
      one who just says "Ke- ke- ke- ke!" Or something similar, you can't expect
      me to remember the exact wording. She actually did have her post-fight
      dialogue changed though, it now says "I freaking love making weird animal
      noises!" This is probably the first piece of comedy dialogue in this game
      that actually got an audible laugh out of me. Good bit.

      If you want Ghost Star Beasts though, we've got plenty. I'm just gonna run
      through them all in a row. I have arranged them all in order, with

      Okay, that last one was a stretch I'll admit it. But you try coming up
      with stuff that rhymes with "channeler". And look at this thing, those are
      some pretty alluring hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of the NPCs up to this point have been mentioning "mist"
      gathering in the tower. At the spot where Marowak was in the vanilla game,
      we get some pretty length flavor text that furthers this build up of mist
      as being important. The full line is as follows: "The mist in the room
      coalesces in front of the staircase. It takes the form of a ghostly little
      girl. Suddenly, her flesh begins to fall off her face. She turns towards
      you, letting out an ear-piercing shriek. GIRL: BE GONE FROM THIS PLACE!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Judging by Inoyu's Stardex entry, it's already pretty strongly associated
      with Ghosts, and is obviously a creature made a pure mist, so that's my
      guess as to what's going on here. For now though, we've reached the end of
      what we can do at Beast Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a couple quick notes from Route 8 before we get to explore Celadon
      City. Rocky Dan tried to learn Hyper Voice, which is a pretty good move in
      a vacuum but I'm kind of a big fan of my current moveset. I think the only
      things I'd want from it now are a better Rock move and Explosion over
      Selfdestruct, if possible. From another fight, I never really appreciated
      how annoying Zapodi was going to be to fight as an NPC's Beast, missing
      one Wrap means you're eating a Super Fang for half of your health, which
      really softens you up for the rest of the team. Another NPC let me know
      that Weedimp evolves with a split evolution depending on whether you use a
      Holy Soul or a Dark Soul. My guess would be we'll get to see one or both
      of these final forms in he Grass gym, Erika had baically two aces in RBY
      so having both would make sense as a counterpart to that.
