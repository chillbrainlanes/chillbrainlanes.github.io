    <p>
      It was at this point I went go reload the save state that I'd made so I
      could get The Peeker back... Only to realize that I either forgot to make
      one or it didn't save correctly or something. Either way, my last save was
      right outside Mt. Moon just after I'd evolved Rocky Dan, so I had to do
      all of Mt. Moon over again. I'm choosing to believe that The Peeker took
      getting traded away really personally and so wanted to annoy me. It's got
      video game creepypasta powers after all, save states are a domain under
      its control. I'm sorry buddy, it won't happen again.

      Well, the trek back through Mt. Moon wasn't especially noteworthy,
      although I did get a lot more opportunities to use Rock Throw and see if
      it's accuracy has been changed at all: It doesn't seem like it, I was
      missing about half of the time. Pretty funny stuff. There is one last
      matter to attend to before we enter the city though: A TM on the ground,
      that will change the course of the playthrough.

      I was just thinking: "Rocky Dan is pretty busted for this point in the
      game right now, but the problem is he's not quite busted enough." Getting
      a TM for an incredibly powerful Steel move assuades those fears that I was
      definitely having, and nobody else on my team can learn it anyways. I
      considered removing Rock Throw instead of Tackle since it was so
      inaccurate, but it's important to consider: Rock Throw missing all the
      time is kind of funny. So Rock Throw stays. Oh, and there was nothing new
      in the tall grass on this route, other than wild Bokongos which we hadn't
      had the chance to catch yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, here we are in Cerulean City. The music here is the Water Club
      theme from TCG GBC, which fits well but I do wish there was more original
      music and weirder choices, even if all of these tracks are great. I learn
      from some NPCs that Bill is in fact still Bill, and rather than a
      Pokémaniac they just call him a Collector. There's also an NPC that offers
      to trade a Spriggle for a Quincy: Having the other starters available as
      in-game trades is a cool way of doing it, I approve.
    </p>
    <figure>

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

    <p>
      From the person who explains what the badges all do, we also get to see
      what each of the badges has been renamed to. In order, the new names
      are:<br />
      • ROCKINBADGE<br />
      • SURFINBADGE<br />
      • MAGNETBADGE<br />
      • PRIDEBADGE<br />
      • NEPUBADGE<br />
      • MARSHBADGE<br />
      • PYROBADGE<br />
      • SUMMITBADGE<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first two I was really hoping they'd all be in the same "-'in"
      format, but oh well. Curiously the Marsh Badge looks to be unchanged. Is
      that gym's leader still going to be Sabrina? If so will this be lampshaded
      at all? This also poses the question of Team Rocket: The name of the last
      badge is different, is the boss still Giovanni? Stay tuned for the answers
      to all of these questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real reason to care about the badge man is that he's got a Rare Candy
      hidden in his backyard. Don't worry, that's still here and accounted for.

      Lawncrete here gives another name to a creature we haven't seen yet.
      Sounds to me like a Grass/Rock type, which would make the second one after
      Mosston, unless it's related. I guess it could also be Grass/Ground or
      something as well. In other news, an NPC that describes what Repels do
      says they keep away "bugs and weak Star Beasts".

    <p>
      Is the idea here that there's non-Star Beast animals and this is basiclaly
      just bug spray? I guess theoretically there's non-Star Beast dogs, judging
      by Bladeberus's description. Although I feel like that might just be a
      direct translation from Vast Fame's game? Maybe later dialogue will make
      this more clear.

      One thing I don't ever expect to be clarified is this line in the bike
      shop: "I heard there's a bike out there that can write! Can you imagine
      that? A bicycle writing fanfiction?"

      Alright, enough screwing around. Varik is back in town and ready to
      rumble. And this time, his bird is a whole lot fatter.

      This thing was kind of a major threat. XMVSF had a type advantage but its
      Thundershock would've been a 3 hit KO, and it was slower and got 2 shot.
      Mr Bungle tried to get some damage on the board, but didn't get very far
      either. Toby Kebel had to come in and show them how it's done. (Glared it
      and then clicked Wrap a bunch). After Tomaroc went down, his new Starbie
      was another new guy.

      Rumpel, who I would bet 20 dollars evolves into Stiltzkin, only used
      Teleport and then died. So I supposed it's the Abra expy. The Beast that
      came in next kind of really annoyed me though.

      Come on dude! That's my thing! You can't do my thing! He even used Wrap
      with it! It missed though, because he doesn't have the master's touch. He
      will never have the unbreakable bond that I have with The Peeker (except
      when the bond was broken for a little bit but shhhhh don't worry about
      it).

      The nameless, swagless, pathetic Manhandla went down fairly easily, as did
      the still unevolved Quincy that came out as his final Starbie. Quincy had
      Comet Punch which is kind of fun, that move getting wider distribution in
      the game called "Star Beasts" makes sense. After his miserable defeat,
      Varik mentions that Bill "seems like a kook" and that he turned himself
      into a Beast, saying "something about Gene Splicing". Seems like an odd
      piece of dialogue to add here, is that foreshadowing some kind of new
      mechanic? We're not gonna find out if we spend more time lollygagging
      here. Go home Varik, and take your miserable hands with you. The golden
      splendor of Nugget Bridge stretches before me, and your silly hat is
      blocking my view of its glory. (The glory is that I get a nugget at the
      end.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The trainers on Nugget Bridge were unremarkable: The Bug Catcher had a
      Slashopper which was kind of neat, but nothing cool otherwise. The music
      for this route starts with just percussion for a while, before its weirdly
      intense melody kicks in. I wouldn't mention this normally, but since I was
      entering into trainer battles so soon after I entered the route every
      time, I never actually heard the intense melody until I started talking to
      the Team Rocket guy at the end of the bridge, and it kicked in right as he
      started talking about Team Rocket. I initially mistook it for a dynamic
      music change to match the dialogue, but it wasn't, the song is just like
      that. Kind of funny.
    </p>
    <p>Anywho, the Rocket had this thing.</p>

      All time ROM hack banger right here. If I saw this thing when I was 13 I'd
      think it was the coolest shit in the world. Now that I'm 22 I also think
      it's still like, maybe the fourth or fifth coolest shit in the world. It
      still ranks. This thing had Shadow Claw which was interesting, but wasn't
      a Ghost since it took neutral damage from Wrap. Another Dark type,
      probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nugget is great, but the really great item at the end of Nugget bridge
      is right here at the end:

      Thunder Wave is absolutely massive for our team, probably even better than
      the Flash Cannon TM I was popping off about earlier. A whole lot of my
      team can learn it as well: Toby Kebel, XMVSF, Rowsdower, and Mr Bungle are
      all options. Out of these XMVSF and Toby probably don't need it since they
      already have Glare, but I'll have to think on Rowsdower versus Mr Bungle.
      Having Paralysis on the thing you're using Wrap with in the first place is
      hugely beneficial, but it would also let Rowsdower actually contribute to
      the team's game plan more than just being big damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also feeds into another thing I've been thinking about: XMVSF has
      kind of been jobbing. Even its Confusions have not been hitting very hard,
      and its defenses are so low that it makes it hard for it to really make
      meaningful contributions in matches unless it's already got a type
      advantage against what's out. (And even then I got a Gen 1 miss with it
      against a fighting type earlier, lol). I haven't been using Rowsdower as
      much for a bit, since I was kind of thinking XMVSF might replace him on
      the team, but I think I'm taking him off the bench. Super Fang and that
      higher damage output sounds real good right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of Zapodi, the trek to Bill's house didn't have much to note,
      except for the fact that Rocky Dan's Flash Cannon is able to one-shot
      trainer's Zapodis even when it's supposedly not very effective. He's a
      monster, I love it.
    </p>

        <i>スティーリー・ダン・ブラスト !!</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Speaking of Steely Dan dealing huge damage, he learned Selfdestruct after
      a level up here. Only other thing of note before we get to Bill's house is
      the Seismic Toss TM, which I doubt we're ever going to need so I'll
      probably just sell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bill's house, the scenario is basically the same as in RBY, although
      hilariously he's initially relieved that someone "came back" before
      realizing we're not that person and going "Ahem" and going into his usual
      dialogue. Varik just left him here I guess, fun bit of extra character.
      The only other notable change to his dialogue that I noticed was that he
      says "I can't stand rich folks" rather than "I can't stand fancy do's".
      That might just be because "fancy do's" is a slightly odd phrasing (which
      is the reason I remember the line in the first place), but I like to think
      the devs just wanted to add dialogue of someone saying they hate rich
      people. Hell yeah.

      Especially astute viewers may remember that there's something else we
      should be looking for here. And we don't have to look far to find it.

      In the entranceway to the secret garden is this guy, who says his Tearwulf
      thinks i'm a "bad person". in the dialogue, Stella apparently just says
      they are without any of my own input, which is honesty that he
      appreciates. I would've said I was a bad person either way for the record.

    <p>Talking to the Tearwulf also gives us a look at its sprite:</p>

    <p>
      We can go down these stairs to enter the garden itself, but we don't get
      very far before we're stopped by the cops. Apparently he isn't letting
      anyone through until "that creepy guy" is dealt with. I initially assumed
      he was talking about the weirdo with the werewolf, but since he's a cop
      he's actually probably talking about the Rocket who robbed the house.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This guy also has honestly one of my favorite little pieces of dialogue in
      the game so far. He says that he's not letting anyone through until the
      creepy guy is dealt with and "things go back to normal. Well, normal by
      Cerulean City standards, anyways." That's such a fun little bit to add
      that makes the world feel so much more lived in. If you live in Cerulean
      weird shit and crime just happens a lot, apparently. It gives you that
      sense of worldbuilding while still feeling so natural. What a nice piece
      of flavor text. Big fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I returned to take on the gym, I decided to take a look in the tall
      grass in Route 24, which I didn't do the first time I had the chance.
      There's nothing we hadn't seen before as far as I could tell, but it is
      the first opportunity to catch some Beasts that only trainers have had so
      far: Rumpel and Sackran. Rumpel does have Teleport in the grand Abra
      tradition, but that's not actually its only move: It's also got Metronome.
      That's a much more fun gimmick than Abra, this would be a fun Starbie to
      raise. I think I'll pass for now though. Sackran is unsurprisingly Dark,
      and also has Teleport although it's in addition to a more normal moveset.
      The connection to the Mario RPG Crooks deepens: Those guys ran away from
      battle a lot too. Intentional reference? Probably not it's a common troupe
      for thief enemies in RPGs, but it's fun.
