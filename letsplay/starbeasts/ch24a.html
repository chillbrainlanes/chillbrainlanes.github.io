      At last, we've reached the summit. The pinnacle of Star Beast battling
      awaits just beyond the door. All of our adoring fans have gathered here at
      the Indigo Plateau to cheer us on to victory.

      Everything at the Indigo Plateau is bigger and better. The battles are
      more intense, the stakes have never been higher. The Beast Center needs to
      staff an Auraklos instead of a Cheppi because the injuries are going to be
      just that severe. We're gonna need some last minute training if we're
      going to conquer this final challenge.

    <p>
      I don't really want to do any actual training though, so we're just gonna
      use these 8 Rare Candies I've got sitting in the PC. With these I bumped
      our whole team up to Level 46, plus The Peeker and Toby Kebel to 48 since
      they have lower BSTs that the rest of our squad. During this Toby tried to
      learn Outrage, which was quite temping, but I decided that I valued Sludge
      Bomb's consistency over Outrage's power and I declined to learn it. Maybe
      if I didn't have Surf I would've taken it.

      Well, after stocking up on healing items, our preparations are complete.
      Only one thing left to do, let's head on in.

      I was certainly expecting to see Lorelei up first, but it's good to see
      Sabrina is okay after she got kicked out of her gym. Despite the lead
      matchup working out pretty well, this Magusand might have been the single
      most frustrating Beast I faced in the whole league. Sand Attack plus a
      Wrap-style move in Time Stop, really I'm just getting a taste of my own
      cheese medicine. The rest of her team put up a hell of a fight too: Pheras
      has a great design but that Double-Edge hit <i>hard</i>, and I never
      expected to find a Sagyig outside of that secret Creepypasta area. Her
      ace, although it had a great sprite, unfortunately put up 0 resistance to
      a Dark type.

      I have two questions about this guy. One, with all the TCG music in this
      game, do you think him being "Science type" themed is a reference to the
      Science Club from the TCG game. Two, does he shit in that trash can. This
      fight wasn't quite as tricky as the last one, but it did punish me for not
      checking Slobbix's type when I caught it: I assumed it was just Poison,
      but I guess it's Poison/Dark. Go figure.

      I led with Rowsdower assuming this lady would be Ghost themed, but she was
      Dark and led with a Dark/Fighting type, so that threw me off. Good thing
      Rowsdower's got a move for pretty much any matchup, and also good thing
      that this guy decided to not hit me with anything except a Skull Bash.
      (Which was Not Very Effective? Maybe it's like, Steel type now? No clue.)
      Owai was a bit of a stinker though, landing two successful Hypnosises and
      taking out Tubi with the help of a crit Ominous Wind. Shoutouts to its 7
      damage Hurricane against Rocky Dan, by the way. The flinch was the perfect
      punchline for that. Decaplon was also pretty scary, but I made the guess
      that it was probably Steel and The Peeker was able to take it out with
      Fire Blast. Easy prediction for this game, I know. Fittingly against the
      Dark type expert, Rowsdower finally learned a Dark move better than the
      one he basically started the whole game with, and we upgrade to Dark Pulse
      for our last two fights.

      Well, I led assuming Lorelei would be here, but I guess she's not on the
      Elite 4 any more. I retract my previous praise about introducing the Elite
      4 early, lol. In other disappointing but also kind of funny news, rather
      than the banger Grandmaster Duel theme, here we get a slightly sad GBC
      rendition of "Holding Out For A Hero". You know what, it's amusing enough
      that I actually like this decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      How poetic that in one of our final battles we must face the Beast that
      captivated me so much all the way back at the title screen. I'm sorry it
      had to end this way, Rollen. In hindsight I don't know why I didn't just
      go for a Falcon Punch against Vulturnus, did I just forget it was Fighting
      type? Clearly not, since I Psychiced it. No clue. Huanlong was also pretty
      brutally strong, but enough of our team was able to endure one hit of
      Outrage that we powered through, until we got our first and only Freeze of
      the run. Right on time, you love to see it. Oh yeah, and with both Feilong
      and Thundrhawk this guy's kind of got a Super Street Fighter II The New
      Challengers themed team. That's kind of funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there's only one fight left. And you all know who it is. Let's
      finish this.
