      They might not be much to look at. But believe you me, this kid is gonna
      make us a star. For one, peep that name. "Drakelet". That sure sounds like
      a Dragon type to me. And this is the first one I've seen too, so it's
      gotta be rare. But that's just the future. What about the present? What's
      the short-term value proposition here?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me hit you with Drakelet's entire moveset. I'll give it to you in two
      words. Wrap. Glare.

      This kid is OU ready. We're playing Moneyball here, and we scored a star
      player for 200 of whatever the currency in this game is called (Is it
      still Poké? The symbol is the same. They probably just forgot to change it
      lol). Glare has 75% accuracy and Wrap has 85%, hit both of those chances
      and you're soloing any Starbie in the league. This is our angle. This is
      our ticket to the pennant.

      Doubters might say "Wait, this thing is just Poison type, why is it named
      Drakelet?" To the haters I say, I have no clue but I'm rolling with it.
      Doubters might also say "What's up with this nickname?" Non-doubters would
      probably say that too actually. And I can tell you with certainty the
      thought process that led to this nickname. We start with "Drake" in the
      name and it being the "B. BASILISK" Starbie. Basilisks turn you to stone.
      So we've got "Drake" and "Stone". Drake Stone was a supporting character
      in the 2010 film <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentice</i> starring Nicholas Cage.
      Drake Stone was played by English actor Toby Kebbell. "TOBY KEBBELL" was
      too many letters for the nickname entry box, so I dropped one of each of
      the doubled up consonants. See? Very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to the team, Toby Kebel. You're gonna go far in this industry.

      With a team of three powerful allies and also Stanko, I returned to the
      grass to train, and immediately realized that Drakelets are actually not
      rare at all. Apparentlt I just got very unlucky. This led to several
      thrilling duels with even-leveled wild Drakelets who also had Wrap and
      Glare. This is the kind of gripping gameplay that only Generation 1 can
      provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long, I had Toby at level 7 and decided I was ready to give
      Slashopper another shot. And I didn't even bother getting another
      screenshot of the fight, because it was a pretty hilarious anticlimax.
      Toby took one not-very-effective Double Kick, landed a Glare, and
      proceeded to clip Wrap for the rest of the game. The bug never even got to
      take another action before it was caught. That's what we're looking for,
      baby. That's what we're here for!

      Gave this critter the nickname "The Don", which felt fitting for a scary
      boss waiting in a little hideout. It's likely not going to stick around on
      the team long-term, but I'd be silly not to keep it in the party for now
      with these stats. It having Double Kick will also be handy for the first
      gym, assuming it's still Rock themed.

      While I was in this cave, I decided to check if there were any other new
      encounters just walking around. And there was!

      I would not have ever guessed that this thing was Rock by looking at it,
      but that seems to be the case since it resisted Wrap. (Or it could be
      Steel I suppose if Dark is in the game. Or maybe a new type? Is this thing
      Gas are we Pokémon Browning this shit?) I kind of don't like looking at
      this thing so I'm gonna pass for now. This also seems to be all that's
      available in the cave, so we're done here for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we finally head north from Viridian, there's a couple houses and
      spots I didn't check. One house is pretty unremarkable, other than having
      a Bird sprite overworld Starbie that's referred to as a "Tomaroc". Stands
      to reason that that's the evolution of Roc. The hidden potion on the Cut
      tree is here and accounted for. The Old Man's catching tutorial is also
      still here, and he catches a Spriggle. It was at this point I realized
      that I never saw a second Spriggle in all the time I was grinding on that
      route, so that was the <i>actual</i> rare encounter. Oh well. But the real
      juicy stuff is the replacement for the Trainer's School.

      The teacher screams at you in all capital letters that "I'M NOT A STALKER,
      YOU'RE A STALKER!" The blackboard, as you can tell, is full of "REASONS
      WHY JUSTIN IS JUST THE CUTEST". The flavor text for these options is
      probably what you'd expect, including making threatening comments about
      his girlfriend Stacy.

      When I mentioned "ROM hack humor" in the first post, this is exactly what
      I was talking about. This is the funniest thing in the world to the person
      that made this hack. Does it feel like it fits with the rest of the game?
      Oh hell no, every finger on this hand is a sore thumb. But if I saw
      someone with a hand like that? I would think about it every day for the
      rest of my life. It's things like this that make these games special to
      me, it's something where you see through the work itself into the creator,
      and you really appreciate that this is a work of passion by an individual
      who just wanted to make the kind of game they'd want to play. It's kind of
      art in its purest form. It's the direct successor to the lineage of the
      earliest humans singing songs around fires or painting pictures of animals
      on walls. They did it cause they loved it, and they hope you'll love it
      too. And I absolutely do.

      Alright, now we're actually out of here. I poked my head in the Route 2
      grass to see if there was anything new, but I didn't see anything in a
      couple encounters so I decided to just move on. While I was here though, I
      did happen to notice that overworld items aren't actually balls any more,
      they have a unique Chest sprite. Scans, but it weirdly makes them look way
      bigger than the old Balls even if they're not actually any taller or
      wider. Not a big deal though.

      Dear viewers, I know what you're thinking. You want one last diversion
      before we go into Viridian Forest, right? We haven't wasted enough time.
      Well have I got news for you. Inside the Viridian Forest gate is an old
      man who's offering an in-game trade: Slimogg for something called
      Climpale.

      Stanko, I always knew I caught you for a reason. Your time has come. Let
      us all take a brief moment of silence to remember Stanko and all he
      contributed to the team. (Functionally nothing). Say hello to Mildred the
      Climpale, who will probably contribute about as much.

      This is basically just a Shellder, down to the similar cry, but I'll give
      them some grace since this is probably one that originates from Vast Fame
      trying to imitate Shellder for their own game. The name Mildred, by the
      way, apparently comes from this old guy's dead wife. He took in this
      Climpale off the beach because he was lonely, but it never took a liking
      to him so he wanted to trade it for a Slimogg which are supposed to make
      better pets. I hope Stanko is enough to fill the hole in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      So! Viridian Forest! Right from the start there's an NPC I didn't remember
      who was looking at the big tree. It's a Bug Catcher, who says he "found it
      first", referring to something that's apparently in the tree that he can't
      reach. In any case, he does challenge me to a battle.

      I suppose now is a good time to mention: Both of the battles against Varik
      we've had so far have had very intense music. I was wondering whether that
      was special music added just for Rival fights in this game, or if all
      trainers would have that tune. Sounds like it's just for the Rival, since
      the BGM here is the Normal Duel theme, once again from the TCG game.
      Honestly, I'm not sure it fits quite as well. It's a very chill track,
      which works great for a card game, but I feel like a normal RPG battle
      theme could use a bit more energy. I can't complain too much since it's
      still a great track, but that is a piece of criticism I would levy towards
      the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      After thoroughly trouncing the Bug Catcher's Scorpsy, I check the tree to
      figure out what it was that he was looking for. I'm rewarded with an item
      called a "Steely Gene" which, beyond being the name of my Steely Dan cover
      band, sounds like it's probably some sort of evolution item. This is
      confirmed by it being usable with the same "NOT ABLE" interface that
      evolution stones have in vanilla RBY. Handy to have just in case, but not
      of any use quite yet.

      Our next trainer fight is against a Lass, who says there's more than just
      bugs in this forest. Case in point, this thing.

      The problem with Electric types is that there's not actually a lot you can
      do with Electricity beyond just like, "this is an animal but it has
      electric powers now". Game Freak themselves keep making different electric
      dogs and stuff, so it's hard for me to criticze an electric capybara
      either. Especially since I'm so on board with Rowsdower. But I do really,
      really wish they went with "Zappybara". Like that's so much better it's
      unreal. Rename Zapodi if you have to. Oh well.

      This battle was actually surprisingly annoying. I missed one Wrap, and it
      got to land a Thundershock which paralyzed me. I then got very unlucky
      with full paralysis and wound up having to switch out to clean up the
      fight. This is also the battle that made me realize how important PP
      management is going to be with the Wrap strategy: Even with 20 PP, you
      have to use the move many, many times to accomplish anything, so I had to
      go back and heal up Toby Kebel's PP stocks before venturing further into
      the forest.

      This Bug Catcher says he's looking for a Dragleam. They're supposed to be
      "rare and powerful", evidently, and another unrelated Bug Catcher mentions
      that he would've won if he had one. I do enjoy the idea of the rare
      encoutner in an area being something that everyone is looking for, it
      really makes the player want to search for it themselves. I'm kind of
      liking my team right now, so I don't know if it's something I'm gonna
      spend a lot of time hunting for, but I think it's a cool decision.

      Alright, that's the last of the dialogue that I really wanted to mention
      in the forest. The rest of it is largely unchanged beyond what you'd
      expect (i.e. the "CATERPIE won't cut it!" guy now mentions the Starbie he
      uses instead). So now it's time for a lightning round of every new Starbie
      I saw in here.
    </p>

    <p>
      This thing barely looks animate that's just a bunch of leaves. Maybe it
      makes more sense in its Stardex entry? I dunno, I only ever saw it from a
      trainer.

    <p>
      I encountered my first Mulcrunch after my first Mulchoon, but looking at
      them now (and knowing that a Bug Catcher had Mulchoon) I'm fairly certain
      that Mulchoon is actually Mulcrunch's "Metapod". As a reminder to our
      viewers who did not commit every single piece of dialogue to memory like I
      do, Mulcrunch eats meat and is stronger, but slower than Cupeedle.

    </figure>
    <p>
      Speaking of, here's Cupeedle. If you put a gun to my head and asked me to
      choose whether I like Cupeedle or Mulcrunch more, I'd probably start
      crying. (For reasons unrelated to Cupeedle and Mulcrunch I would just be
      really scared.)

    <p>
      And here's what I'm led to believe is Cupeedle's evolution. The "Somn" in
      the name here makes me think this thing might learn some sort of sleep
      move? I have no evidence of this though. I supposed Butterfree does learn
      Sleep Powder, so it wouldn't be too out of left field.

      Finally, there's this guy. This is not a Star Beast, as much as it looks
      like one. It is in fact, a person, who takes the place of the ionic Level
      9 Weedle Guy from the original games as the "boss" of Viridian Forest.

    </figure>
    <p>
      This fight certainly feels more like a "dungeon boss" than Level 9 Weedle
      Guy did. For one, this is just a memorable looking dude. He's also got
      different battle music than everyone else: I wonder if this means
      different enemies have different battle themes depending on their trainer
      class, EarthBound style. That would be kind of sweet actually, and
      honestly makes me a little softer on the music choice for the other
      trainer battles if it's only used for the weaker enemies. Most importantly
      though, it's the moment you've all been waiting for. The grand reveal
      of...

      This guy! What a little critter. If Star Beasts released instead of
      Pokémon, this is who they would've put into Smash 64 instead of
      Jigglypuff. It was a worthy foe for even the mighty Zap Rowsdower too,
      with its Pounds doing just as much damage as Rowsdowers Bites even while
      they were both neutral damage. Still, we were able to win the day through
      Dragleam's Disable hitting Screech which, I will remind the audience, does
      literally nothing for Rowsdower currently. (That's how Disable works in
      Generation 1 by the way, it's jsut random lol).

      Maybe this Collector should talk to the guy in the gate to the north here,
      he doesn't seem to believe "a magical pink creature living in the forest"
      is real. Again, genuinely fun bit of small worldbuilding to have so many
      NPCs talking about this rare Starbie. Big fan.
