    <p class="centertext bigtext">Episode 14: Rocket Science</p>
    <p>
      This has been quite an eventful day in Celadon so far, but there's
      unfortunately not really much to see in the Game Corner Hideout. The
      spinners don't move you any faster here, which is a bit of a drag. All the
      usual grunts are here an accounted for, with lots of Agahnoblins,
      Deathseers, Slimoggs and Needolfs. This actually made me check, and yes,
      Needolf is the evolution of Slimogg. I wouldn't have guessed that in a
      vacuum, to be honest, but it makes sense thinking about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These trainers also gave me a perfect opportunity to try out Tubi in
      battle, and see what's up with Falcon Punch. It's Flying type, has 5 PP,
      and I'd say the animation is appropriately climactic.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/falconpunch.webp" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >i recorded a gif of using it against a rocket but the file didn't
          save properly, so you'll get to see it inflicted on this random wild
          eggerot instead</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We did pick up a couple exciting TMs here. First was Horn Drill, which
      only Tubi could learn but I decided hey, why not. Not like I'm going to
      use Conversion. I wound up using Horn Drill exactly once, against a random
      Shochran just for fun, but it landed it. At Level 31, Tubi learned Thunder
      Wave, which I obviously taught over Horn Drill. All that said, Tubi had a
      100% succes rate with Horn Drill. Pretty funny stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also got a TM for Hurricane, which was very exciting, and a lot of our
      team could actually learn it.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Out of these, Rowsdower was the one that had the move I most wanted to
      replace, so he finally lost Screech for Hurricane. Kind of crazy that he's
      had Screech ever since I caught him despite never having a physical move,
      only for it to finally get overwritten by the first one he's ever gotten.
      I did actually still get some small use out of Screech though in a couple
      fights, which was funny.

      Giovanni isn't here! The boss of Team Rocket is a very dapper looking
      gentleman named Lucian. No relation to the Sinnoh Elite 4 member I take
      it.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/lucian.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >i know i've said this before but i love every original sprite in this
          game. this is such a great "pokemon villain" design</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      His team consisted of a Scorphiro, who's shockingly annoying to take down
      when you don't have any Ground or Fire moves, a Charcold, who somehow
      survived a Rocky Dan Flash Cannon (at very low health but still, it was
      even super effective), and a Predatox, who's new. Looks to be Slimogg's
      final form.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/predatox.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

    </figure>
    <p>
      While he's got a spiffy look to him, he acts more or less the same as
      Giovanni did, and coughs up the Silph Scope just as easily. So now we're
      back off to Beast Tower to go quell that rowdy ghost. On the way though,
      we've got a drink now, so why not swing by Saffron and see what's going on
      over there?
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/guard.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >the guard is still not high on us going to saffron right now with all
          the criminal activity, but we did give him a drink so i guess he's
          just in a better mood now</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Saffron's got a very nice new tileset going on, complete with real roads
      and cars! It is still a Generation 1 hack, so the cars aren't like,
      moving. But they're there! That's a nice touch.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The city seems even more overrun with Rockets than usual, the only
      non-Rocket NPCs I've seen have been in buildings. That does however
      include my GOAT Mr. Psychic, who gives out a TM that's so much better than
      the one you get from Sabrina it's not even funny. And look at everyone
      that can learn it!
    </p>

      I wound up giving it to Zorotl, to give him some more Special coverage.
      This also gives it a functional difference from Vaporeon, which is nice
      because as-is that's basically all it was LOL. We obviously can't go into
      Sabrina's Gym yet, but the Fighting Dojo is open. Or should I say the
      Yin-Yang Dojo, which is what the sign out front says.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/meanbastards.png" />

        <i>hey guy i should you should call sabrina a bastard to her face</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Practitioners of the Yin-Yang Dojo's fighting style seem to use the Dark
      type mostly, rather than Fighting. Lots of Agahnoblins and the Zapodi
      line. Some pretty tough cookies, certainly higher level than what we've
      been facing before.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

          beast we fought the whole time, but it's a new design so i was gonna
          have to post it anyways, and a pretty cool one too</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      An interaction I learned about in this gym is that, if you interrupt your
      opponent's attack with a Wrap, they can still use an item if that's what
      they were queued up to do. The Black Belts in this gym absolutely love
      using Dire Hits, so this came up a handful of times.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/blackbelt.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>pictured: guy who bought dire hits in bulk from costco</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Beyond the obvious Hitmon replacements, there was one other new Beast
      here. I wish I could tell you much about it though, all it did was use
      Barrier once and then the trainer just used 2 Dire Hits on it. I think
      this game was advertised with "smarter AI", by the way. On the bright
      side, Zorotl learned Body Slam after this fight, which is exciting, and
      made me remember I don't think I ever used that TM. Oh well.
    </p>

      The master of the dojo of course uses our two options for gift Beasts.
      With the gym's Yin and Yang theme, you can guess the theme they follow.

      This guy loves talking about "The light and the darkness... Separate they
      are weak, but together they are strong." Afterwards though, he only offers
      to let me take either the light or the shadow, which means they're gonna
      be weak. What the hell dude. Well if I'm getting swindled I might as well
      drop a save and check out both of the options.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/shadolosdex.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

    <p>
      Shadolos is a Ghost/Fighting type, and comes with Swords Dance, Shadow
      Claw, and Jump Kick, plus good stats everywhere except Special (which
      isn't even all that low either). This seems like it would be a great Beast
      to use on a team, but I'm not sure I love it quite enough to want to drop
      any of my existing squad.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/auraklosdex.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >"It embodies life, nature, warmth, and love. Its hold aura heals all
          that come near it."</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I'm going to be going with Auraklos for my actual choice, since I'd rather
      have the Beast that embodies warmth and love than the one that will
      literally kill me if I stand close to it for too long. It's gonna live in
      the box, but I like it well enough. It's a Psychic/Fighting type, has
      pretty good stats everywhere except Attack, and comes with both Screens
      moves, which would be a bit cooler if they worked like they did in later
      games but it gives it some tanking power which is cool with this statline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and in case you're curious, the two scrolls behind the Beasts read "If
      you must life to protect those you love, then lie with your love for them
      in your heart." for Auraklos and "Purity of heart matters more than purity
      of purpose." for Shadolos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, with that little diversion out of the way, we can properly head back
      to Beast Tower. The wild Beasts were all just Stranghosts and a single
      Trapestry, but I imagine if I stuck around for longer I'd be able to find
      some more exciting ghosts. Handily, you don't actually have to walk back
      down the tower after you rescue Mr. Fuji, he just warps you straight to
      his house. A nice bit of QOL, but it did keep me from potentially seeing
      some more ghosts in the wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the tower, we get to the mist and the little ghost girl,
      which I guessed had something to do with Inoyu. I was very wrong!
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/embalmak.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >omg a mummy named "mak", awesome reference to the 1991 beat 'em up
          classic captain commando</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I did want to catch this thing, but this is an uncatchable encounter.
      That's probably true of the Marowak in the original game too, but I don't
      recall ever really trying to catch that Marowak in the first place, since
      Marowak is kind of terrible in RBY, lol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently, this ghost actually was the ghost of a dead child, but she
      seemed to get calmed down after we beat the shit out of her. Or maybe this
      was her Star Beast which is also a ghost? No clue, not my problem. What is
      my problem is dealing with the Rockets up here. It's a couple uneventful
      Grunts... and Lucian! That's new, there was never really much of a boss
      here in the original game. Funnily, he still acts like a normal trainer
      where he notices you with a line of sight bubble and everything.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/luciantower.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >technically this screenshot was from after i beat him but his
          dialogue when i encountered him the first time was "Have we met
          before? Regardless, you'll have to wait your turn. I have some
          questions for the old man..." which is crazy bc we fought the first
          time like less than 30 minutes ago</i

      His team got some marginal upgrades, with Charcold evolving into Charkonro
      and a Weedimp joining the party. The biggest change is that he's now got
      Full Restores, which was a very rude awakening after I spent like 11 Wrap
      PP trying to grind down a Steel type. It even healed the paralysis! What a
      sham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well it's over now, Mr. Fuji is saved and gives us the Beast Flute. In his
      house there's a couple Beasts running around that the game helpfully gives
      us little splash screens for.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/whirliesplash.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I do really enjoy all of the overworld Beasts showing you these screens,
      that wasn't a feature in the vanilla game if memory serves. The whole draw
      of this game is all the original creatures, so getting to see as many of
      them as possible in as many situations as possible is really nice. Like.
      I've got the Water starter and Varik's got the Grass one, there's a real
      chance I wouldn't have gotten to see Embrain's final form if not for here.
      It's cool that this gives me that chance.
