  </body>
  <p>
    With the Rocket scourge vanquished (roughly) once and for all, the citizens
    of Saffron City have returned to the streets. Apparently nobody told the
    gate guards, since they still tell you to "be careful out there", but maybe
    that's just general advice. The Copycat's here, the guy in the Center who
    thinks the singular form of "species" is "specie" is still here, everyone's
    accounted for. Unfortunately, Copycat isn't playing "a game with Mario
    wearing a bucket on his head" any more, instead it says it's "a game about
    raising and training dragons!" That's pretty benign in this game's world,
    but people do love sports and simulation games I suppose.
  </p>

    My next step should probably be heading to Fuschia City, doing the Safari
    Zone quests to get the necessary HMs, and then fighting that Gym. But
    Sabrina's gym is right here and I'm in the area anyways, I might as well
    give it a shot, right? We've got two Dark types on our team, even if we're a
    bit underleveled, I felt pretty confident we could power through.
  </p>
  <p>
    Or that's what I thought, anyways. Apparently, in the chaos and lawlessness
    of the Rocket's rule over the city, the Gym was ransacked and taken over by
    a Biker gang. Sabrina and her Psychic-type gym trainers are nowhere in
    sight... And it now makes sense why she was the only Kanto leader to not be
    changed in this game.

    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Now that order has returned to the city, the bikers had every intention of
    leaving the gym. Unfortunately, they're not smart enough to figure out the
    teleporter puzzle, so they're just stuck in here.

    I feel like a lot of my praise of this game has felt kind of back-handed.
    When it comes to stuff like the Glitch City creepypasta section or random
    weird references, I appreciate what they bring to the ROM hack experience,
    but I don't think they necessarily "land" in the traditional, critical
    sense. I can say with confidence though that this doesn't apply to this gag,
    I think this is genuinely very entertaining and creative. It fits into the
    established story of Saffron in Gen 1 while also just being really funny on
    its own. It does have some of its own ROM-hack-ism to it, they drop a couple
    "damn"s and one calls himself a "dyed-in-the-wool badass!" But still, this
    is great and I'm a big fan of it.
  </p>

    If it's more references you want though, (and that Akira slide wasn't good
    enough for you), then it's references you'll get.

    This does make the pig goblin being a "servant of the dark lord" make some
    more sense. I think it would be the funniest thing in the world of this
    thing originally came from Shi Kong Xing Shou, because they could certainly
    get away with it, but that's probably not the case.
  </p>
  <p>
    Seems like this gym has mostly Dark types, but not to a fault. Most of the
    Gyms in this game seem to have other types at least mixed in among the
    regular trainers. Case in point:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/slaymore.png" />
    <figcaption class="centertext">
      <i>philip slaymore hoffman</i>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    All signs point towards this being the Dark Soul evolution of Weedimp,
    especially given it seems to be Grass/Steel. That's a really annoying
    combination of types for us (and just in general, hello Ferrothorn). This
    team could really use a Fire or Fighting type move. Maybe I'll teach Tubi
    Fire Blast once we get to Cinnabar, although I reckon that might be too late
    at that point.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only other trainer of particular note before we get to the big boss is a
    Gambler who says he caught some rare Beasts in the Safari Zone. His team was
    a Jellyelly, a Kremate, and a Lawncrete, so it sounds like you'll be able to
    catch the starter Beasts there. That's another fun way to allow you to
    obtain all three starters, I support this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our "gym leader" so to speak is a mean lookin' fella named Shayton, the boss
    of the biker gang. He seemingly wants to fight us just because I looked at
    him funny, but I suppose I would've challenged him to a fight either way
    anyways. He intends to send us packing just like "that broad with the long
    hair", so I guess it was him who was responsible for kicking out Sabrina.
    For the curious, he's still go the gym leader battle music.
  </p>
  <figure>

    Shayton led with a Slaymore of his own, and I led with Toby Kebel.
    Unfortunately, Toby couldn't do much against it other than paralyzing it,
    since it pretty well walled all of Wrap, Bubblebeam, and Dragonbreath. So I
    Glared it an then tagged out to Zorotl to attempt to Ice Beam it, forgetting
    about the type effectiveness glitch and also blanking on the fact that this
    is a Grass type so it's going to have super effective STAB against me here.
    Luckily, even catching a (guaranteed) critical hit Razor Leaf on the switch,
    it only seemed to be a three or four hit KO on Zorotl, while even a "not
    very effective" Ice Beam did over half. Maybe it is just a visual bug after
    all? Or maybe Slaymore's just got really low Special, which would explain
    both of these things. Either way, Zorotl's Special is sky high, which has
    been incredibly good for us.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/nfeicebeam.png" />
    <figcaption class="centertext">
      <i

  </figure>
  <p>
    After contributing very little to this fight, Toby Kebel was trying to learn
    Sludge Bomb. Dragonbreath being mostly unresisted it pretty cool, but it
    does have pretty low base power, and the only time I'd really want to use
    non-Wrap moves is either to clean up weakened opponents or on things that
    resist Wrap for safety. Sludge Bomb and Dragonbreath are both bad against
    Steel types, and I'm keeping Bubblebeam to cover Rocks, so I decided I might
    as well swap out Dragonbreath for a Poison move that just has higher base
    power.
  </p>
  <p>
    It would've maybe been funnier if I had gotten rid of Bubblebeam though,
    because Zorotl also scored a level up off the same Beast, and he learned
    Bubblebeam himself. I'm so glad to have some real Water STAB on him now.
  </p>

    Next in is a Beast that looks to be the evolution of Speakeasy. That critter
    was pure Fighting, and I was willing to take the bet that it wasn't a Dark
    type, so I stayed in and hit it with a Psychic. It was not very effective,
    likely meaning this thing is Steel as well. This type bug really does make
    this Steel type problem even worse.

    Zorotl was able to clean up with a couple of Bubblebeams, in some part
    thanks to a missed Jump Kick. It still only deals 1 crash damage, which is
    amusing. Coming in to take revenge our horse with an incredibly overkill
    Thunder is the last evolution of Whirlie.

    Knowing this line is, despite all appearances, pure Steel type, I threw
    Rocky Dan in. It was hard for me to imagine it having much to hit a
    Rock/Steel type from what I'd seen, and Earthquake seems like our best bet
    to take this thing down. Unfortunately, Rocky Dan not only hit the 1/256
    miss on Earthquake, but then also immediately died to a 4x effective Drill
    Run. Embarassing performance.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/heneverscored.png" />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Knowing this thing has Drill Run really narrows my options to deal with it.
    Rowsdower's Thunderbolt would hit it hard, but I don't want to mess with
    that. I decided The Peeker was my best bet, and I decided to just go for
    Crunch right away rather than messing with any Wrap shenanigans to avoid any
    backfiring misses, especially considering the resistance. Surprisingly
    though, Crunch was actually able to take down Eradicane (when combined with
    the damage of one Zorotl Bubblebeam). Guess I shouldn't doubt The Peeker, he
    puts in the work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Roudning out Shayton's trio of evolved forms of early game Cave Beasts is
    the evolution of Slashopper.

  <p>
    While it outsped The Peeker and got off a Bug Bite for a huge chunk of
    damage, we got the Thunder Wave off as well. I knew that one Wrap miss would
    be sending The Peeker to an early grave... So it's a good thing he never
    missed a single Wrap! That's my guy! That's my GOAT! Never doubt The Peeker
    baby! Now we've gotten it down to very low health and we've got Mach Punch
    to clean up, the exact reason I kept that move around. It's even Fighting,
    so it'll be super effective.

    A Vuhlandron was Shayton's ace, which would've been a lot cooler if a
    trainer in the dojo next door didn't also have one. Tubi cleaned up
    Sabrantis with a Flash Cannon, by the way, and stayed in here to Thunder
    Wave Vuhlandron. It went for a Drill Run as well, which would've worked out
    great if I wasn't a Flying type. It did have one other trick up its sleeve
    though, which I didn't see coming (although I maybe should've).
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/pkstarstorm.webp" />
    <figcaption class="centertext">
      <i>is it a flavor win or a flavor fail if sagyig learns this</i>

  </figure>
  <p>
    Whatever type PK Starstorm is (I'd guess Psychic all things considered),
    Tubi handily resists it, and it's got a recharge turn just like Falcon
    Punch. Maybe there's a bunch of these typed Hyper Beams that are moves from
    other games? I hope we see at least one more. Other than that, this thing
    wasn't too scary at all, and we're able to defeat Shayton and claim the
    Marsh Badge (which were just sitting in a box in the corner of the room, so
    he lets us take one.)

    Afterwards, he pulls out a little piece of paper and reads us a spiel about
    how Beasts up to Level 70 will obey us. Sounds like he's warmed up to us a
    bit after losing to us, so at least he's a good sport. He also gives us the
    Psywave TM, although he says he doesn't know what it does. That's fair
    though, because I've never been entirely clear on what Psywave does either.
