      Welcome to Celadon City, the land of opportunity. As long as the
      opportunity is related to gambling.

      I'm not going to mention every single NPC that does this, but there's a
      lot of dialogue that mentions how to evolve various Star Beasts. Scorpsy
      with a Steel Gene, Leeghoul, Tomaroc, Charcold, Flewnicorn and Canghoulit
      all with Fire Stones, Rocken with either a Steely Gene or a Holy Soul,
      Sackran with either a Holy Soul or a Dark Soul, and there's even more that
      I didn't mention. I do genuinely appreciate this, having to look at the
      documentation kind of ruins some of the fun of playing blind, and being
      able to organically discover this stuff by talking to people is much more
      rewarding anyways. There's a lot of item evolutions in this game, it seems
      like. I wonder if that was an intentional decision so that these NPCs
      could be placed around the world to lead to cool moments of discovery for
      the player. Whatever the case is, this is a good decision, big fan.

      In the apartment building, the lady who has a Meowth that brings home
      money in the vanilla game instead has a Pumajin that does it. Thank
      goodness I don't have to see one in this room, otherwise I'd be running
      away and dropping all of my money too.

      Upstairs is the Soul Valor meeting room. I wasn't sure if Soul Valor was
      the name of the team or the name of a person, but I guess this confirms
      it's a team. It's pretty easy to have a dev room that comes off as pretty
      corny, but they mostly stick to similar dialogue as the vanilla game here,
      which is nice. The story writer says they really like Ivy, Mizu, and
      Sabrina: I assume Ivy is the Grass-type gym leader here in Celadon, and
      this also gives us confirmation that Sabrina is still the same as the
      vanilla game. It's the story writer who's telling me this though, so I
      assume they've got something going on there. The only other thing of real
      note is the programmer, who looks like this.

      Only other thing is this building is, naturally, the Eevee room on the

      Inside is... whatever this is. The game is prompting me to nickname it,
      but I still haven't seen it yet, so that's going to make it harder. I can
      at least make a guess about what it is based on its name, though.

      I'll be honest I was drawing a blank, so I just tried to come up with
      something that would be funny in a vacuum. So I guess welcome to the team,
      Tubi.

      The typing here is actually quite interesting in the context of our team.
      This would be our second Steel type, but Rocky Dan and Tubi wouldn't
      actually share any overlapping weaknesses: Flying negates Ground and
      Fighting, and Rock negates Fire. Especially with the type matchup bug,
      having these dual types with synergy helps even more, since those neutral
      hits will become not very effective. Not to mention, you can't walk 2 feet
      in this game with running into another Steel type, so this was kind of
      inevitable.

      Even more interesting, the blackboard behind the table gives some more
      interesting info on this thing. It stands for "Technical Machine
      Artificial Intelligence", because it's capable of learning any TM or HM
      using its "Technique Analysis System (or TAS)". It also says it has the
      defensive ability to "change its element type at will", which I assume is
      just referring to Conversion, a move it starts with. Its starting moveset
      is pretty stacked already honestly, with Flash Cannon and Recover giving a
      really good baseline. I think Tubi will actually make for a pretty solid
      addition to the team, and it comes at Level 30 for free. Welcome to the
      team, scary robot pal.
    </p>

      Evidently, these machines were being developed in the hope they could be
      mass produced and sold as weapons, but they'd need more funding to make
      that practical, which they aren't getting. In its own way, it's probably a
      moral good for me to take this prototype away, just in case
      Lockheed-Martin decides to buy out the rights to it or something.

      Unfortunately, this means that Mr. Bungle is leaving the team. His
      contributions will not be forgotten, but being a Poison type is a real
      liability, and I think our two Wrap users is more than enough to still
      have a thematic team.

      Well, if we're doing to have a Beast that can learn every TM, we might as
      well swing by the department store and see what they've got for sale.
      Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da is playing here, which scans to me. Although if I was
      working retail at a place that played nothing but Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da on
      repeat I'd probably end up on the news. In any case! Their selection of
      TMs includes: Double Team, Reflect, Hurricane, Horn Drill, Egg Bomb,
      Dragon Claw, Take Down, Submission, and “FLCPNCH”.

      Now, I had a guess as to what this abbreviation meant, but I didn't want
      to say anything before I checked it to be sure, so that I wouldn't look

      This fucking rocks. This is some real 2009 PokéCommunity forums Hack of
      the Month shit right here. The most epicest attack evar. It's the freaking
      Falcon Punch dude. God. I love it. I love this game. I'm teaching this to
      Tubi yesterday. I don't even know what it does. What type is it? Fighting
      would make sense, but Flying would as well since it's "Falcon" punch. Is
      it really low accuracy? Does it have a charge-up turn? Does it have a
      recharge turn, even? I cannot wait to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The video games floor clarifies that there's no trade evolutions in this
      game, which I didn't really need to know I think I could've guessed that.
      One of the Game Boy kids complains that the Lunozen he wanted to trade to
      evolve actually evolved at level 40 instead, and that he "hates not being
      inconvenienced!" The flavor text for the SNES games is also mostly the
      same, including my single favorite line of dialogue in the first
      generation.

      The floor above that we get to the evolution stones. Importantly this is
      where we're going to get to evolve Zorotl. I'm almost certainly going to
      turn it into an Aquamentus with a Water Stone, since we no longer have a
      Water type on the team, but I do want to see all the other options
      anyways. So I dropped a save state and starter with the Fire Stone.

      I sure am glad I didn't need to fill the role of a Fire type on my team,
      my lord. Real horses are more than scary enough, we don't need to go out
      of our way to make a scary horse. It's a Fire/Dark type as well, and I
      definitely don't want a third Dark type on my team.

      Okay, well that was a bust. We might as well check the Thunder Stone
      evolution, hopefully it's not as horrible as this thing.

      See, this is more what I expected. "Thunder Hawk" is actually the full
      name of T. Hawk from Street Fighter, not sure if that was on purpose but
      if this guy learns a move called "Mexican Typhoon" I would pop off.
      Electric/Flying, which is good, but makes me wonder what Aquamentus's
      secondary type is going to be. If anything, maybe it's just Water.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Alright, neither of those two options were really what I wanted, and it
      would've felt kind of wrong to not make Zorotl into something blue
      anyways, so Water Stone it is.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is, in fact, pure Water. Its stats look pretty similar to Vaporeon's
      but with maybe a little more Attack. That's handy, since we probably won't
      have a good STAB special attack for a bit... Maybe I should've saved that
      Bubblebeam TM for longer, lol. Once we get Surf we'll be fine, and until
      then I can grab the Ice Beam TM off the roof and use that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did consider giving Ice Beam to Tubi instead, especially since I'm more
      likely to use them in the upcoming Gym than I am to use Zorotl. (And in
      hindsight I maybe should've just waited to evolve it so I could have
      another thing that resisted Grass and had super effective STAB, rather
      than something that's <i>weak</i> to Grass, lol). But Zorotl needs a
      Special move in the short term. If I still want to give Tubi an Ice attack
      down the road, I can always give it Gen 1 Blizzard. I also grabbed the
      Counter TM, which everyone on my team can learn, but there's a whole lot
      fewer Normal attacks in this game than in the original, so its utility
      seems a bit limited unfortunately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roof has some unique music, oddly. It definitely sounds like another
      chiptune version of an existing song, but I was unable to identify what it
      was. The three drinks had different names: "Aloe Juice", "Ash Coffee", and
      "Tabascoda". I know people who would probably buy Tabasco Soda, to be
      honest, but I'm just gonna stick to Aloe Juice. I think if I gave
      Tabascoda to the gate guard he probably would not be put in a good enough
      mood to let me through. Oh, and there was a minor graphical glitch in the
      dialogue with getting the Ice Beam TM where the text went a little bit off
      the dialogue box.

      After some more talk about "THE BIRD!" the game brought me to a menu that
      prompted me to "Choose a Beast". Not sure what's going on here, but just
      in case I'm losing whoever I select here, I'm picking Tubi as the
      sacrifice since I just got it and I have the least attachment to it.

      "THE BIRD!" has to mean something. I'm guessing that the cop outside being
      afraid for his pet Roc (not to be confused with a pet rock) is supposed to
      a hint: Maybe this is just a dressed up in-game trade? I remember there
      being wild Rocs just to the east of Celadon, so I resolved to go catch one
      and offer one of those to the headless man. Before I leave the hotel
      though, it looks like my old pal the as-yet unnamed Gym Guide is staying
      here.

      So I ventured back through Hell and met up with the headless man again.
      Just as I suspected, it's a trade. Complete with the traditional in-game
      trade Words of Power.

      Tragically, all we get in RBY is "TRAINER" for the name of the NPC, but
      the whole time I was holding my breath waiting to see what it was. And
      it's...

      It's Giygas. Like, even before I realized its name was just Giygas
      backwards, I was thinking "This is Giygas". Even before I read its Stardex
      entry or saw that its nickname was "MOTHER", I was thinking "This is
      Giygas." I'm pretty confident that Giygas is not the "Mother" in question,
      for the record, but the point is made.

      Part of me is disappointed, I was sort of expecting something scarier and
      weirder. But honestly, even that doesn't take away from my appreciation
      from this whole segment of the game:
    </p>
    <p>
      In general when we're talking about criticism of games, there's a thought
      that if you can see "through the seams" of a work, so to speak, that it
      means that the work is not doing its job well. If a game is selling you on
      a wondrous world of escapist fantasy, you shouldn't be thinking about the
      methods of its creation. If you aren't immersed, then it's a failure. From
      my perspective though, I really enjoy viewing the end result of a game
      holistically as a product of the process of its creation, and the lives of
      the people who helped to create it. This lens of analysis is more common
      in the worlds of the more traditional arts: Your music, your painting,
      your poetry and prose. Many of these mediums are intrinsically more
      personal, as they're often or always the work of an individual. Once you
      get to something as multidisciplinary as a game, it becomes harder to see
      an individual's vision really shine through. This is one of the reasons
      why, traditionally, games have been considered more of a subset of
      software than they have of art. To this day, even with the broad
      understanding that video games are art, we still more often talk about
      "the games industry" than we do games as an artistic field that progresses
      in the same way the more "respected" arts do. Games are seen primarily as
      products, or increasingly, as services.

      This is one of the reasons I love amateur projects like ROM hacks so much.
      Most games like this aren't created out of a desire to sell something to
      fill a niche in a market, they're created because someone thought
      "wouldn't it be cool if..." They're almostalways created by people whose
      only game development experience comes from ROM hacks and fan projects. To
      that end, they're in conversation with their medium in a very unique way.
      When I'm playing Star Beasts, I'm always thinking not just about the
      content of the game, but why it was made like that. What the thought
      process was, what the inspirations were. That means I'm not immersed, in a
      sense, but it certainly doesn't mean I'm not invested.

      None of this is meant to demean the work of professional game developers.
      There's an even more fringe school of thought that postulates that great
      art can never be created with a profit incentive, and that any commercial
      work is artistically worthless. I don't remotely agree with that, my
      annoyance with games being limited to an "industry" extends equally to a
      lack of willingness to give serious artistic credence to triple-A releases
      as it does to a lack of consideration of the smallest titles. But I do
      interact with these two clades of gaming in very different ways, and
      there's nothing that can replace or replicate the feeling of playing a
      weirdo ROM hack. (Other than, perhaps, a bootleg! Full circle moment, you
      love to see it.)

      All this is to say: This whole segment of the game has been delightfully
      inside baseball. The visual language of "glitch city" doesn't just require
      you to be a Pokémon fan: It requires you to be an <i>online</i> one.
      Understanding the EarthBound reference here requires a particular fandom
      overlap that the devs were (reasonably) betting their audience would fall
      into. The whole willingness to have a bizarre, tonally dissonant
      creepypasta horror segment in this game speaks to a real stream of
      consciousness design process that I can't help but have an admiration for.
      Soul Valor made the game they'd want to play, with no compromises. And
      that owns.

      I absolutely don't want to put this thing on my team because it kind of
      looks not remotely fun to use, but I'm glad I have it. With that little
      adventure done and dusted, it's time to go see if it's viable for me to
      buy a Hyper Beam TM from the Game Corner yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short answer, no, even if I put all of my money into coins I would only
      get about halfway there. I could gamble, of course, but I do eventually
      want to finish this playthrough, so we're just gonna continue on without
      Hyper Beam, as much as I love it in this game.

      The Star Beasts for sale at the Game Corner are Rumpel, Dragleam, Robby,
      Xiaolong, Cheppi, and Flewnicorn. Flewnicorn is the most expensive, so I'm
      glad I had the wherewithall to go back to the Secret Garden and catch the
      one there. Evidently, the TMAI robots used to be sold here as well, based
      on this guy's dialogue: "Apparently, selling weapons of war to minors is,
      and I quote: 'Morally wrong.' What's this country coming to!" I suppose
      that makes sense, it's got Conversion and a very Porygon-esque cry. I
      definitely wouldn't have gotten one if it had cost 9999 coins, so it's a
      good thing they stopped so I could just get this thing for free.

      Before heading into the hideout, the only other point of interest in the
      Game Corner, is DJ Double Cut's brother, DJ Single Cut, who's sat down at
      a slot machine. He's evidently trying to win enough coins to train up a
      powerful team to beat the Gym, and become famous that way. I'm not sure
      gambling is the best way to make that happen, but you do you dude.
