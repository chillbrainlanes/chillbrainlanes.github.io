    <p>
      The Gospel of John begins with one of the most famous biblical passages:
      "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
      was God." Star Beasts: Asteroid Version is basically the same thing,
      except instead of the Word there's a ghost and a little spiky dude, and
      instead of God there's Wacky Workbench "P" mix from Sonic CD (JP/EU OST).

      Not really sure what's up with the music choice, but it's only a very
      small clip of the song before we transition to the main title screen. The
      animation plays out basically the same as the classic Nidorino and Gengar
      one. Here we also get out first look at the Super Game Boy border for this
      game. It looks good! I honestly was not expecting an SGB border so this
      was a pleasant surprise. We've got an amusing selection of critters here:
      They look suspiciously Grass, Fire, and Water themed, so my guess would be
      that these are our starters.

      The title screen is exactly what you'd expect in terms of format: Our
      protagonist and a cycling display of various creatures. But how
      <i>about</i> that protagonist! What a great sprite and character design.
      It doesn't feel like a Pokémon protagonist design, it feels like some
      other team trying to make a protagonist for "Pokémon but cooler", which is
      so perfect for this kind of game. They've definitely got some very modern
      day feeling androgynous swag, but there's nothing wrong with that. Plus it
      means the devs didn't have to worry about programming in two different
      hero designs to cover all possible genders! Work smarter, not harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to avoid waiting for the demo reel to cycle through all the new
      critters since I would rather see them in context, but the one shown here
      did briefly catch my eye before I pressed Start. This dragon lookin' dude
      rocking the fuck out on the drums. Look at them they're so happy! Look at
      the little music notes!! I really hope I can use this thing on my team,
      I'm already a big fan. Oh, and the music here is the title theme from the
      Pokémon Trading Card Game game for Game Boy Color: Definitely a fitting
      and catchy track although not exactly an inspired choice.

      Professor Cherry is the name of our guide through the introduction. Her
      dialogue has a much more bubbly feel that Oak's did, but the beats she
      covers are more or less the same. Of course, this world is populated by
      mysterious creatures called Star Beasts, not Pokémon. She clarified that
      "most people just call them Starbies", which is handy because "Beasts" is
      kind of hard to say really fast. The one she shows you here is the same
      spikey fellow from the intro, which checks out.

      The name options for our protagonist are all appropriately space-themed.
      Which is cute, but it does make me wonder if there's any lore behind Star
      Beasts actually coming from space in this game. Maybe the museum in Pewter
      City will have something about this? Guess we'll see. For now, I decided
      to just go with Stella, since it was the first option and felt like a good
      name. And I'm glad I did too, because I'm fairly certain this bit is
      exclusive to you selecting Stella as a name:

      Good lord, what a pull. Apparently this is what Cherry learned my full
      name was, but "That's. That's a lot.", so she's just going to call me
      Stella. This is likely completely inscrutable to most viewers here, but I
      do actually happen to know what this is a reference to: It's this decade
      old YouTube video about a man on a couch reviewing a toy violin, with some
      delightfully horrible translation. (And the Angry Birds theme). It's a
      great video, but this absolute non sequitur gag in the first minute of
      gameplay really caught me off guard. This is so delightfully ROM hack. I
      didn't exactly find this funny, but it did make me very confident that I
      chose the right game to play for this. This is gonna make for great TV.

      Our rival name is only slightly less eventful. Rather than forgetting his
      name, Cherry asks "What name is he going by now?" which implies some
      exciting things about this dude. The real money is in the middle of the
      three name options here.

      Varik is the name of the protagonist of 1991 PC-98/FM Towns RPG
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandish_(video_game)">Brandish</a
      >. More relevantly, that character's name and design were repurposed for
      the main character in Toby Fox's infamous "EarthBound Halloween Hack".
      That hack is most well known for being the origin of Megalovania, but it's
      also pretty widely known to have some... questionable content of its own.
      I am unshakably certain that this is why the name is an option here. In
      the vain hope that choosing it will trigger exclusive dialogue of an NPC
      calling me the F-slur, I went with Varik for the rival's name.

      With that, the journey begins. The player's room is pretty much unchanged
      from the original, the only different flavor text I could find was
      "Pokémon books" being replaced by "Star Beast books". In general, if I
      ever don't mention text as being different, assume it's the same except
      with "Pokémon" replaced by "Star Beast" or "Starbie". I was really hoping
      the game console would be something different, to be honest.

    </figure>
    <p>
      The only actual gameplay element in this room, the PC, actually does have
      a change that sticks out though: In addition to giving you a Potion, it
      also gives you an Antidote. This bodes... ill. Feels like the kind of
      thing they had to add in playtesting due to something being really
      obnoxious with poison. Guess we'll see.

      Our mom continues to leave our gender vague. Whether this is a
      "purposefully ambiguous so you can project onto them" situation or a "this
      character is strictly nonbinary" one is not something I'm sure we'll ever
      learn either way. All three suggested names definitely have a more
      feminine apperance than a masculine one, but also the space theme also
      makes them all believable as names most of the NB people I know would
      consider choosing. (I hate to make generalizations but like, this is my
      lived experience.)

      Well if there was ever any doubt about the Varik thing before, the TV's
      flavor text reading "A child is attacking a skeleton wearing a blue
      jacket. Where have I seen this before?" pretty much seals it. Kind of
      crazy that the film adaptation of Undertale in this setting is the
      Genocide route and not True Pacifist. Idk, maybe it's a spinoff show or a
      bonus episode or something. Does seem like the kind of episode they'd air
      reruns of a lot either way, so it being on TV here makes sense. It was
      also at this point that I decided to go and check the settings to turn up
      the text speed, and was met with a very amusing setting: There's an option
      for "Difficulty" but the only option is "Yes". So I guess this playthrough
      will be played on Yes Difficulty.

      Pallet Town is about the same as ever. I don't recognize the music here,
      but it's quite pleasant. The "Technology is incredible!" guy is here an
      accounted for, and lets you know that this game has a Run button,
      certainly a welcome feature. The one NPC outside of real note is this
      lady, who asks if we found our "lost dog". I do happen to know that, in
      the original Shi Kong Xing Shou, your dog is transformed into a Star Beast
      and becomes your starter, so that may be what this is referencing? Maybe
      these fellows on the SGB border aren't the starters after all.

      Rather than a sister, our rival has an actual parental figure, although he
      doesn't say much of interest. The big draw here is the map on his wall,
      which confirms that the world is mostly just the familiar Kanto region,
      although with a couple additions. I tried not to really pore over every
      special area so as to preserve some surprise, but I did catch a glimpse of
      a couple names that got me pretty excited.

      Before long, we step out into the grass and are stopped by the Starbie
      Prof herself. They did do a good job with her dialogue, it's the same
      broad strokes as Oak but she feels much younger and more energetic. She
      also says "geez" like two or three times throughout the whole next series
      of cutscenes, which is pretty amusing. Here in the lab, we've got our
      choice of three Star Balls, just as you'd expect. I guess our dog will
      stay lost for now.
    </p>
    <p>Our options are...</p>

      The name here is pretty amusing, and all but confirms this is a creature
      from the original game. I don't know why you'd name this Quincy if not for
      it being a literal translation.

      This is the one of the most "this was made for a Pokémon-like game by
      someone who wasn't trying to ape Pokémon's design sensibilities" designs
      I've ever seen. Leads me to beleive all three of these starters come from
      Shi Kong Xing Shou, which makes sense since the original creatures didn't
      come until later in the project's life.

    <p>
      Poor guy! How could you poach such a polite looking fellow. I decided to
      choose Jelleye, I think they've got a winner's spirit and a positive
      attitude which are essential for winning battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full transparency, I'm writing this all up two days after I played through
      this segment of the game. With that in mind, I have genuinely zero
      recollection of where how my brain led me to name this creature after
      American experimental rock group Mr. Bungle. But that's what I did. So
      welcome to the team, Mr. Bungle!
    </p>
    <p>
      Funnily, Varik goes out of his way to choose the starter that beats ours
      here, so we know he's canonically a tryhand. Important characterization!
      Then we're off into our first battle.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/lv5moveset.png" />

    <p>
      Our starting move set perhaps gives away why that Antidote was in the PC
      at the beginning of the game: The rival battle being able to Poison you
      sounds kind of miserable. But we have that on our side this time, and it
      gives us a super-effective move against Quincy. Lot of good that type
      matchup is doing you now, buster!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this did not work nearly as well in practice. Poison Sting
      has a measly 15 base power, so even when doubled due to the weakness it's
      only dealing 30 base power: Less than our opponent's Pound. Quincy also
      starts with Harden, which makes our Stings even more flaccid. Even when
      landing two(!!) critical hits, we still had to use the Potion to win the
      match, but win it we did. And our reward for reaching Level 6 could not
      have made me more excited.

    <p>
      At this point I was begging and pleading on my knees. Please please
      <i>please</i> let this game have unmodified RBY Wrap mechanics. I'll spoil
      for you now: It does, and I'm absolutely thrilled. Wrap is so funny in
      RBY, and the computer opponents aren't gonna get annoyed at me wasting
      their time like OU ladder players, so this is the perfect chance to use
      it. I'm not sure how fast Mr. Bungle is, but if I can build some paralysis
      support into this team and find a couple more Wrap users, we might just be
      off to the races.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Varik dealt with, you might say we're "On the Road to Viridian City".
      The guy who gives out the potion is here with the same role as always, but
      he oddly says his name here (Justin). I wonder if that's just a dev
      calling out one of their friends. Or maybe Justin will be an incredibly
      important recurring character, who knows. Of course, with our first tall
      grass comes our first new Star Beast.

      Just being a generic animal definitely makes me assume this is a Vast Fame
      original rather than a new design, although if I ever saw that for a
      Starbie that actually was a new design I'm gonna feel like a real asshole.
      This thing's also got Poison Sting, so it's another good candidate for
      being the reason behind the PC Antidote. I Wrap a couple into the dirt for
      the experience here.

      After a grueling journey we arrive at Viridian City. The first thing that
      catches my eye is the Chansey replacement in the Starbie Center. Once we
      find a center without someone rudely standing in the way, we should be
      able to learn what this thing's name is. But for now it remains a mystery.

      This NPC offers to helpfully explain to us about the two kind of
      caterpillar. According to the expert, Mulcrunch eats meat, while Cupeedle
      doesn't, and Mulcrunch is stronger but slower while Cupeedle is fast but
      "a bit flimsy". However, they're apparently both "really useful". I wonder
      if Shi Kong Xing Shou had two different bug families like this or if one
      or both of these are Star Beasts originals. Once I'm finished with the
      game I'll have to see if I can find a list of all of the original game's
      creatures so I can learn definitely who comes from where.

      The other notable changed dialogue that I found on this first trip is this
      guy in the Mart, who says that the shop "sells many RADIATIONs. I mean,
      ANTIDOTEs." This is almost certainly another oblique reference, and if all
      of them are as specific as that Ashens reference from earlier I should
      probably get used to not being in on the joke for a lot of this game's
      flavor text. In any case, we pick up Cherry's Parcel and we're ready to
      head back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything goes as expected, we get the Stardex and head back north. On
      the way back up through Route 1 though, I do learn of a second Starbie
      that can spawn there.

      Not really anything to write home about, but the name just being "Roc"
      means this was definitely another port from the original, so I can't be
      too upset. It's not like the real Pokémon games don't have just as many
      forgettable birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pick up some Star Balls once I'm back in Viridian so we can start
      formally putting together our team. Before we leave Viridian, I definitely
      want to check the grass on Route 22 for any new Starbies and take on the
      optional Rival fight. And new Starbies are exactly what I find.

      I'm pretty sure this isn't actually our lost dog, but it's someone's lost
      dog. My Poison Stings being not very effective confirm that this is a
      Poison type, which makes me not especially interested in adding it to the
      team for now.

      Now this guy I can really get down with. The continuity of the angle of
      the stick is a little fucked up on the sprite, but maybe it's just a bendy
      stick. It also has the move Sharpen which is novel, cool to see that move
      getting some wider disribution. I decided to look around a bit more before
      committing to catch it though.

      Now we're talking. Honestly, I enjoy this design but I don't quite love it
      as much as Spriggle. However! This team is going to want one or maybe even
      two Electric types on it if we're trying to build with Wrap, for Thunder
      Wave purposes. I'm not sure I'll be keeping this dog on my team long-term,
      but I think it'll be nice to have in the short term. It had the move Bite
      in the battle, but I'm not actually sure if Dark is a type in this game or
      if it's just Normal. But we're catching it, so we'll find out.
    </p>

      In addition to being a better way of disposing of car batteries than
      throwing them in the ocean, Zapodi has something of an X-Factor. Not only
      is Bite indeed a Dark-type move here, but Zapodi is also Electric/Dark,
      meaning it's already got a 60 power stab move on a pretty strong Special
      stat. This game doesn't have the Physical/Special split which is fine, but
      it does make Zapodi's other move being Screech pretty funny. Screech is
      actually pretty good, but as of now it has no moves that can actually make
      use of it. (Testing this in a Zapodi mirror match is how I got the chance
      to test if Phys/Spec was in the game). Oh well, just from the first couple
      battles using this it's already doing huge damage with Bite to things that
      are the same level, so I think he'll be a great addition to the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yeah, and when I think of "Zap" there's only one name that comes to
      mind. So welcome to the team, Rowsdower.

    <p>
      At this point I started training Rowsdower to get him to roughly the same
      level as Mr. Bungle, since they'll probably be my main two fighters for
      the foreseeable future. After running around in this grass for a while
      two-shotting scorpions and birds with Bite, I've realized that despite
      being the first thing I ever got on this route that Slimogg seems to
      actually be a pretty rare encounter. So even though I said I wasn't
      planning on making it a permanent addition to the team, I decided I might
      as well catch one once I found a second one. So that's what I did.

      Welcome to the team, Stanko. You're probably just going to be switching
      into things and getting knocked out. But you're a Poison/Normal type and
      you've got Scratch, so if you do get a free turn you do have a decent
      button to click with it at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      With two team members ready to go, it's time to rematch Varik. Same
      dialogue here as the original. He's added a Roc to his team, which isn't
      too surprising since it's filling the role of the Spearow on the original
      rival's team.

    <p>
      While Rowsdower is favored in this matchup since Gust actually has been
      updated to Flying in this game (Did you know Gust was Normal in RBY?
      Pretty funny stuff), a couple Sand Attacks and a 3 level disadvantage
      means I can't actually beat this bird 1 on 1. Bungle picks up the knockout
      with some classic Wrap goodness, and not only scores a level up but also
      learns Water Gun, which will be a huge help. Not so much against Quincy,
      who comes in next and has Leech Seed and Harden, but Bite being Special
      allows Rowsdower to take it down. Good teamwork, fellas.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point I was about ready to head back and start for Viridian
      Forest, but there was something strange that caught my eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gee, this cave entrance wasn't here before. What wonders lay ahead? (The
      wonder was a bug).
    </p>
    <figure>

    <p>
      The cave, or at least the accessible part of it, is very tiny. But in this
      little area is some sort of creature with the beetle sprite. Apprently, it
      was responsible for digging this tunnel, but it got lost trying to get
      home. Amateur mistake, to be honest, and now it has resorted to violence.
      That's not going to solve anything, man!
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/slashopper.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">

        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In my infinite wisdom, I didn't decide it was worth healing before I tried
      to battle this bug, so now I'm stuck with a very weak party up against a
      Level 10(!!!) bug with a Scratch that took care of both of my remaining
      creatures in one strike each. After blacking out I returned for a rematch,
      only for Rowsdower to once again be felled in one turn by a super
      effective Double Kick, and Mr. Bungle only barely fared any better.
      Clearly we are dealing with no ordinary Slashopper. This is a true force
      of nature. Even the mighty power of Stanko, the level 3 Slimogg was
      nothing in the face of its Scratching prowess. We were gonna need to grind
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's back to the Scorpsy mines. Or so I thought! After another
      blackout, the first encounter back on Route 22 was a hitherto unseen
      beast. Perhaps our meeting here was fate, the destined hero who has come
      to slay the mighty Level 10 Grasshopper Thing.

      They might not be much to look at. But believe you me, this kid is gonna
      make us a star. For one, peep that name. "Drakelet". That sure sounds like
      a Dragon type to me. And this is the first one I've seen too, so it's
      gotta be rare. But that's just the future. What about the present? What's
      the short-term value proposition here?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me hit you with Drakelet's entire moveset. I'll give it to you in two
      words. Wrap. Glare.

      This kid is OU ready. We're playing Moneyball here, and we scored a star
      player for 200 of whatever the currency in this game is called (Is it
      still Poké? The symbol is the same. They probably just forgot to change it
      lol). Glare has 75% accuracy and Wrap has 85%, hit both of those chances
      and you're soloing any Starbie in the league. This is our angle. This is
      our ticket to the pennant.

      Doubters might say "Wait, this thing is just Poison type, why is it named
      Drakelet?" To the haters I say, I have no clue but I'm rolling with it.
      Doubters might also say "What's up with this nickname?" Non-doubters would
      probably say that too actually. And I can tell you with certainty the
      thought process that led to this nickname. We start with "Drake" in the
      name and it being the "B. BASILISK" Starbie. Basilisks turn you to stone.
      So we've got "Drake" and "Stone". Drake Stone was a supporting character
      in the 2010 film <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentice</i> starring Nicholas Cage.
      Drake Stone was played by English actor Toby Kebbell. "TOBY KEBBELL" was
      too many letters for the nickname entry box, so I dropped one of each of
      the doubled up consonants. See? Very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to the team, Toby Kebel. You're gonna go far in this industry.

      With a team of three powerful allies and also Stanko, I returned to the
      grass to train, and immediately realized that Drakelets are actually not
      rare at all. Apparentlt I just got very unlucky. This led to several
      thrilling duels with even-leveled wild Drakelets who also had Wrap and
      Glare. This is the kind of gripping gameplay that only Generation 1 can
      provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long, I had Toby at level 7 and decided I was ready to give
      Slashopper another shot. And I didn't even bother getting another
      screenshot of the fight, because it was a pretty hilarious anticlimax.
      Toby took one not-very-effective Double Kick, landed a Glare, and
      proceeded to clip Wrap for the rest of the game. The bug never even got to
      take another action before it was caught. That's what we're looking for,
      baby. That's what we're here for!

      Gave this critter the nickname "The Don", which felt fitting for a scary
      boss waiting in a little hideout. It's likely not going to stick around on
      the team long-term, but I'd be silly not to keep it in the party for now
      with these stats. It having Double Kick will also be handy for the first
      gym, assuming it's still Rock themed.

      I would not have ever guessed that this thing was Rock by looking at it,
      but that seems to be the case since it resisted Wrap. (Or it could be
      Steel I suppose if Dark is in the game. Or maybe a new type? Is this thing
      Gas are we Pokémon Browning this shit?) I kind of don't like looking at
      this thing so I'm gonna pass for now. This also seems to be all that's
      available in the cave, so we're done here for now.

      Before we finally head north from Viridian, there's a couple houses and
      spots I didn't check. One house is pretty unremarkable, other than having
      a Bird sprite overworld Starbie that's referred to as a "Tomaroc". Stands
      to reason that that's the evolution of Roc. The hidden potion on the Cut
      tree is here and accounted for. The Old Man's catching tutorial is also
      still here, and he catches a Spriggle. It was at this point I realized
      that I never saw a second Spriggle in all the time I was grinding on that
      route, so that was the <i>actual</i> rare encounter. Oh well. But the real
      juicy stuff is the replacement for the Trainer's School.

      When I mentioned "ROM hack humor" in the first post, this is exactly what
      I was talking about. This is the funniest thing in the world to the person
      that made this hack. Does it feel like it fits with the rest of the game?
      Oh hell no, every finger on this hand is a sore thumb. But if I saw
      someone with a hand like that? I would think about it every day for the
      rest of my life. It's things like this that make these games special to
      me, it's something where you see through the work itself into the creator,
      and you really appreciate that this is a work of passion by an individual
      who just wanted to make the kind of game they'd want to play. It's kind of
      art in its purest form. It's the direct successor to the lineage of the
      earliest humans singing songs around fires or painting pictures of animals
      on walls. They did it cause they loved it, and they hope you'll love it

      Alright, now we're actually out of here. I poked my head in the Route 2
      grass to see if there was anything new, but I didn't see anything in a
      couple encounters so I decided to just move on. While I was here though, I
      did happen to notice that overworld items aren't actually balls any more,
      they have a unique Chest sprite. Scans, but it weirdly makes them look way
      bigger than the old Balls even if they're not actually any taller or
      wider. Not a big deal though.

      This is basically just a Shellder, down to the similar cry, but I'll give
      them some grace since this is probably one that originates from Vast Fame
      trying to imitate Shellder for their own game. The name Mildred, by the
      way, apparently comes from this old guy's dead wife. He took in this
      Climpale off the beach because he was lonely, but it never took a liking
      to him so he wanted to trade it for a Slimogg which are supposed to make
      better pets. I hope Stanko is enough to fill the hole in his heart.

      So! Viridian Forest! Right from the start there's an NPC I didn't remember
      who was looking at the big tree. It's a Bug Catcher, who says he "found it
      first", referring to something that's apparently in the tree that he can't
      reach. In any case, he does challenge me to a battle.

      I suppose now is a good time to mention: Both of the battles against Varik
      we've had so far have had very intense music. I was wondering whether that
      was special music added just for Rival fights in this game, or if all
      trainers would have that tune. Sounds like it's just for the Rival, since
      the BGM here is the Normal Duel theme, once again from the TCG game.
      Honestly, I'm not sure it fits quite as well. It's a very chill track,
      which works great for a card game, but I feel like a normal RPG battle
      theme could use a bit more energy. I can't complain too much since it's
      still a great track, but that is a piece of criticism I would levy towards
      the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      After thoroughly trouncing the Bug Catcher's Scorpsy, I check the tree to
      figure out what it was that he was looking for. I'm rewarded with an item
      called a "Steely Gene" which, beyond being the name of my Steely Dan cover
      band, sounds like it's probably some sort of evolution item. This is
      confirmed by it being usable with the same "NOT ABLE" interface that
      evolution stones have in vanilla RBY. Handy to have just in case, but not
      of any use quite yet.

      The problem with Electric types is that there's not actually a lot you can
      do with Electricity beyond just like, "this is an animal but it has
      electric powers now". Game Freak themselves keep making different electric
      dogs and stuff, so it's hard for me to criticze an electric capybara
      either. Especially since I'm so on board with Rowsdower. But I do really,

      unreal. Rename Zapodi if you have to. Oh well.

      This battle was actually surprisingly annoying. I missed one Wrap, and it
      got to land a Thundershock which paralyzed me. I then got very unlucky
      with full paralysis and wound up having to switch out to clean up the
      fight. This is also the battle that made me realize how important PP
      management is going to be with the Wrap strategy: Even with 20 PP, you
      have to use the move many, many times to accomplish anything, so I had to
      go back and heal up Toby Kebel's PP stocks before venturing further into
      the forest.

      This Bug Catcher says he's looking for a Dragleam. They're supposed to be
      "rare and powerful", evidently, and another unrelated Bug Catcher mentions
      that he would've won if he had one. I do enjoy the idea of the rare
      encoutner in an area being something that everyone is looking for, it
      really makes the player want to search for it themselves. I'm kind of
      liking my team right now, so I don't know if it's something I'm gonna
      spend a lot of time hunting for, but I think it's a cool decision.

      Alright, that's the last of the dialogue that I really wanted to mention
      in the forest. The rest of it is largely unchanged beyond what you'd
      expect (i.e. the "CATERPIE won't cut it!" guy now mentions the Starbie he
      uses instead). So now it's time for a lightning round of every new Starbie
      I saw in here.

      This thing barely looks animate that's just a bunch of leaves. Maybe it

      I encountered my first Mulcrunch after my first Mulchoon, but looking at
      them now (and knowing that a Bug Catcher had Mulchoon) I'm fairly certain
      that Mulchoon is actually Mulcrunch's "Metapod". As a reminder to our
      viewers who did not commit every single piece of dialogue to memory like I
      do, Mulcrunch eats meat and is stronger, but slower than Cupeedle.

      Speaking of, here's Cupeedle. If you put a gun to my head and asked me to
      choose whether I like Cupeedle or Mulcrunch more, I'd probably start
      crying. (For reasons unrelated to Cupeedle and Mulcrunch I would just be
      really scared.)

      And here's what I'm led to believe is Cupeedle's evolution. The "Somn" in
      the name here makes me think this thing might learn some sort of sleep
      move? I have no evidence of this though. I supposed Butterfree does learn
      Sleep Powder, so it wouldn't be too out of left field.

      Finally, there's this guy. This is not a Star Beast, as much as it looks
      like one. It is in fact, a person, who takes the place of the ionic Level
      9 Weedle Guy from the original games as the "boss" of Viridian Forest.

    </figure>
    <p>
      This fight certainly feels more like a "dungeon boss" than Level 9 Weedle
      Guy did. For one, this is just a memorable looking dude. He's also got
      different battle music than everyone else: I wonder if this means
      different enemies have different battle themes depending on their trainer
      class, EarthBound style. That would be kind of sweet actually, and
      honestly makes me a little softer on the music choice for the other
      trainer battles if it's only used for the weaker enemies. Most importantly
      though, it's the moment you've all been waiting for. The grand reveal
      of...

      This guy! What a little critter. If Star Beasts released instead of
      Pokémon, this is who they would've put into Smash 64 instead of
      Jigglypuff. It was a worthy foe for even the mighty Zap Rowsdower too,
      with its Pounds doing just as much damage as Rowsdowers Bites even while
      they were both neutral damage. Still, we were able to win the day through
      Dragleam's Disable hitting Screech which, I will remind the audience, does
      literally nothing for Rowsdower currently. (That's how Disable works in
      Generation 1 by the way, it's jsut random lol).

      Maybe this Collector should talk to the guy in the gate to the north here,
      he doesn't seem to believe "a magical pink creature living in the forest"
      is real. Again, genuinely fun bit of small worldbuilding to have so many
      NPCs talking about this rare Starbie. Big fan.

      With Viridian Forest at our backs, we enter Pewter City and learn the
      answer to the number one question I'm sure all you readers at home have
      had this entire time: What's the name of the Starbie behind the desk at
      the center? Well folks, I'm happy to announce that our top researchers
      have put an end to our long years of wondering. It's Cheppi.

      Cheppi isn't the thing I care most about in this Star Beast Center though.
      And I'm not even talking about healing my entire party for free. No, it's
      this little guy that's the real star of the show.

      "Rocken", with the Monster sprite, who can sing, sounds an awful lot like
      something that would evolve into that jamming-out dragon Starbie we saw on
      the title screen back at the beginning of the game. Whether this is the
      case or not, time will tell, but its placement in this Center has me
      thinking we might be meeting one in battle sooner rather than later.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you all want more ROM hack writing, right? Well here's an NPC that
      explains that the Steely Gene item can be used to evolve certain Starbies,
      by way of a labored, multi-line, all-caps parody of Billie Jean. That's
      the good shit baby. That's what I'm here for.

      The Pewter Museum is here an accounted for, although they must have messed
      with the layout or the pathing of the NPC that tells you you should go
      there, because when he walks off screen he walks straight through the
      sign. But hey, maybe he actually just hurdles it with such grace and speed
      that I didn't even notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside I of course went to consult the wisdom of the dead. The fossil
      exhibit has on display the "skull of a long extinct Star Beast."
    </p>

      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/skulliphone.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The other case, disappointingly, doesn't have a fossil at all. Instead
      it's got what I assume is supposed to be a taxidermied Joltybara? Although
      the flavor text just calls it a "strange stuffed animal". It also says
      "You get the feeling its eyes are watching your every move." This does
      make me wonder what this is foreshadowing, if anything. If Joltybara is
      taking the place of Pikachu as the electric type in Viridian Forest, I
      wonder if it also has some sort of Mimikyu equivalent? Hopefully we learn
      what the deal with this thing is eventually.

      Most of the rest of the museum is unchanged. The guy who bought a color TV
      to watch the moon landing is still here, thankfully. It is a bit odd that
      nothing in the space area mentions anything about Star Beasts. The stuff
      about Moon Stones is also still here, which strikes me as especially odd
      if the Stones are Genes now. Maybe Moon Stones are still in the game as
      the only real Stones? That tracks with this being "Asteroid Version" I
      suppose. Lots of unanswered questions here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other point of interest here on the second floor is actually yet
      another in-game trade. This girl's dad says she's obsessed with Joltybara,
      and she asks to trade for one in exchange for something called a Sillish.
      I probably could go back and find a Joltybara in the forest to do this
      trade, but I'd wager we'll get a chance to see Sillish eventually anyways
      and I decided I'd rather just keep pressing onwards rather than doing more
      backtracking.

      One last thing in Pewter before we take on our first gym challenge. The
      sign that mentions Team Rocket stealing fossils is still here, but rather
      than fossils it mentions "Beast Souls". Really makes me wonder what a Star
      Beast's Soul looks like, especially since this means we'll theoretically
      be picking one of them up in Mt. Moon. Excited to grapple with the
      metaphysical implications of this.

      Okay okay okay. Gym time. We're not dealing with Brock this time around,
      no no no. As our very enthusiastic Gym Guide explains, this is the gym of
      "Big Dave". It's still a Rock gym though. This guy is really jazzed about
      getting to help us become, in his words, the "Star Beast Champerino". When
      you meet someone like this it's best to just humor them, you'll be able to
      exit the conversation much easier that way. So that's exactly what I did
      here.

      Our match against the iconic light-years guy goes off without a hitch with
      all the same dialogue. His pal here is Bokongo, who actually seems to be a
      Rock type which is a nice step up from his RBY equivalent who just had
      Ground. Weirdly this does make two different creatures I've seen so far
      from this game that are themed around drums, also counting the dragon from
      the title screen. I kind of doubt it's an evolution, especially knowing
      about Rocken now, but who knows? Maybe it's a Mantine situation, if RBY's
      engine can even handle an evolution condition like that.

      Answering my biggest burning question ever since I learned his name was
      Big Dave, I'm guessing it's some sort of stage name, since his gimmick is

      The Gym Leader theme here is the Club Leader theme from the TCG game. And
      I kind of have the same complaint as I do with the normal battle theme.
      This is one of the best pieces of music ever composed for a Game Boy game
      for sure, but it's also a very methodical track that fits much better for
      a card game match in my opinion than a normal RPG battle. It's not lacking
      in intensity, but as compared to RBY's original gym battle theme it really
      doesn't feel as urgent or climactic, which fits more with the more fast
      paced gameplay of battles here, even if they're still turn based. On the
      bright side, I do get to listen to this song more though. And speaking of
      songs, Big Dave's first Starbie out is...

      must be. It has to be soon. I need one. I need him so bad.

      Anyways I clicked Glare against this, forgetting that Brock in RBY has 4
      Full Heals. I don't know why, I'm not sure what status you'd even be able
      to consistently inflict on Brock this early in the vanilla game to the
      extent of needing 4 of them, but he's got 'em and that pretty much
      eliminates my Glare strategy. So Mr. Bungle Water Guns, Rowsdower Bites,
      and The Don Double Kicks it is. Rocken goes down fairly easily to the
      team, after which Big Dave sends in his ace:

      He's rocking out dude holy shit!!!!!!!! This is notably a different
      Starbie than we saw on the title screen, although it's definitely related.
      Is this a middle evolution? Or maybe is it some sort of branching
      evolution where each final form plays a different instrument? The
      possibilities here excite me just thinking about them. But for now, this
      totally radical dude is regrettably my enemy, and must fall to The Don's
      mighty Double Kicks. I do have to give a major shoutout to Mildred though
      for switching into a Bide. Congrats Mildred, you've now contributed to the
      team more than Stanko did.

      With Big Dave crushed beneath the unstoppable power of a pointy clam, Vito
      Corleone if he was a grasshopper, a nominee for The Orange Rising Star
      Award at the 2008 British Academy Film Awards, the guys who got into a
      fight with Anthony Kiedis, and a Canadian dog, we claim our spoils: The
      Rockn Badge, the TM for Bide (lol), and two new moves on our team: Toby
      got Poison Sting, which isn't really newsworthy, but Rowsdower got
      Thundershock, which absolutely is. That's a pretty deadly STAB combo for
      this early in the game, and he was already one of the team's MVPs before
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we leave, something I didn't notice until now: The music for Pewter
      City, and Viridian City too, seems to be an arrangement of the RBY Surf
      theme? Like it's undeniably the same melody, just rearranged into
      something more rhymthic and that feels more like a town theme. I guess if
      I didn't already recognize the song it would fit well, but what a bizarre
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of music that wouldn't bother me if I didn't know where it was
      from, Route 3! The music here is the Battle Tower theme from Crystal. It
      does kind of sound like a route theme in a vacuum, but I hear it and I
      think Battle Tower, especially since that melody has been reused for the
      Battle Towers in so many later titles. But enough about music. What about
      a little clown man?

      A trainer on this route had one of these little fellows, with a peculiar
      moveset of Mirror Move and Slam. Slam is a pretty high power move for this
      early in the game, so it was a bit scary to fight. Mirror Move is novel,
      but anything it reflects back at me is going to deal less damage than
      Slam, so it's not all that bad. Type is probably just Normal since I
      didn't find any moves that had different amoutns of damage than usual.

      Most of the trainers here just have various permutations of the Starbies
      we've already seen, which I expect to be a trend in a lot of future route
      areas. One especially notable trainer was the optional Youngster you have
      to jump down the ledge to fight. His dialogue is different for one,
      mentioning how Aspiro can copy any move. But the Aspiro he uses in battle
      is level 14, which is pretty brutal for this early in the game. Toby's
      Glare and Wraps were able to finish the job though, as expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two more trainers at the end of this route, who both posed a
      bit more of a challenge and also had new Starbies to see. The first was a
      Bug Catcher who bragged about having fully evolved Starbies, confirming
      these two as the final forms of our two caterpillars:

      This thing's attacking move was Metal Claw, which is exciting. Looks like
      it's just Bug/Flying like you'd expect though, since it was weak to
      Rowsdower's Thundershock.

      Despite its name just sounding like someone tried to say "Venomoth" with a
      mouth full of peanut butter, I am quite fond of this guy's design. Not
      enough to want to go back and raise a Mulcrunch, but I like seeing a fat

      The last trainer here is probably the actual most difficult fight here.
      This unassuming Lass has a truly terrifying beast at her command:

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>dear robby. how do you type with boxing gloves on?</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Even if I was told that this game featured 100% original creature designs,
      the name "Robby" combined with this design would make me think "this looks
      like it was taken from a bootleg." This is just one of the dinosaurs from
      Bubble Bobble wearing boxing gloves. That's kind of awesome actually. If I
      see one of these in the wild I'll probably try to catch it. What's not so
      awesome is this being Level 14 and having a pretty powerful moveset: Comet
      Punch, Dizzy Punch, and even Mach Punch which is news to me. I believe
      that's the first new move I've seen in the game, and it's a pretty
      exciting addition. Toby wasn't able to get off a Glare against it, and
      both Rowsdower and The Don were to Mach Punch, so I had to rely on Mr
      Bungle to Wrap this dude out. It wound up working out, but it was a close
      fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the noble Robby felled, we get a chance to heal at the Starbie center
      outside Mount Moon, which is very handy. In this time of celebration
      though, we should also remember those who could not be with us. Please
      rise and remove your hats for a moment of silence commemorating a fallen
      hero.

    <p>
      Well damn, I guess this guy just sold me back my lost dog. He did turn it
      into an Ice/Steel type though. Wouldn't have hated if he let me know that
      this wasn't just a Steel dog and has a second type that makes it way
      worse, but I like to assume the best of people so maybe he just forgot.
      This blurb (and this creature design likely as well) almost certainly
      comes from Shi Kong Xing Shou, since the starter in that game is the
      player's transformed dog. Kind of a fun way to integrate that into the
      game here with the Magikarp salesman. This does make 3 different dog
      Starbies we've had so far, and I'm a bit more attached to Rowsdower so I
      don't think I'll be training this fellow long-term. (And I can't even
      nickname it yet...) But it's neat to have.

      Now <i>that's</i> what I'm talking about, baby. Two floating hands. This
      is the perfect Gen 1 design. I already loved it even before it used a
      move. But after a couple turns of weakening it, it somehow wins my heart
      even more by showing off that it <i>also</i> learns Wrap! Now this is just
      pandering. Get on my team yesterday.

      This dex entry makes me question why this wasn't instead found in Mt. Moon
      rather than in some grass in broad daylight. But maybe it's just this
      game's equiuvalent of Zubat and we'll be seeing a ton of them in lots of
      areas. Gotta say though, a Zubat equivalent having RBY Wrap would be
      really mean. Manhandla also starts with Mach Punch, which is a neat option
      to have, especially if a Wrap ends with a low-HP opponent and we just need
      something quick to clean up. It's a pure Dark type, which overlaps with
      The Don and Rowsdower, but The Don was never intended as a permanent party
      member anyways, and two of the same type is pretty managable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the matter of a nickname, when I think floating hands in the
      context of Pokémon, especially RBY and especially with the Stardex entry
      mentioning "the ABYSS", my mind jumps to the White Hands from the infamous
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlGIOehnUNc"
        >"Buried Alive" creepypasta</a
      >. And when I think about hazel and maedotmkv's amazing
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xhhql_gpDY"
        >"normal creepypasta retrospective"</a
      >, which you all should definitely watch if you haven't seen it yet. The
      less I give away about the video's premise the better, but it did inspire
      this nickname. Welcome to the team, The Peeker.

    <p>
      Now to the matter of training The Peeker up to the rest of our team's
      levels. This grass has lots of wild Aspiros, which are theoretically nice
      to train against since they're weak to Mach Punch, but they've also got
      Mirror Move, and <i>we're</i> weak to Mach Punch too, so it pretty much
      comes out in a wash. There's also lots of Rocs, who I can confirm aren't
      Normal/Flying since Mach Punch wasn't very effective. Probably just pure
      Flying, if I had to guess. The other Starbie I saw, which I only saw once
      during this grinding session, was this little guy.

        <i>play toys with me</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This polite fellow seems to be Steel, Dark, or both, since Mach Punch was
      super effective. I honestly would've guessed Ghost, but I'm glad it's not
      since not seeing any ghosts before Lavender Town is pretty important to
      the game. (But something I see a lot of hacks not follow through with.) I
      didn't catch this guy for now, but I like him. After getting The Peeker to
      level 11, I decided to move on and venture into Mt. Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mt. Moon was definitely always going to be home to many more new Starbies,
      and we find our first one right away.

      Another very odd name, probably a direct translation of something from the
      original game. But it's a very funny image to image this mole lookin' guy
      operating an illegal bar. I wasn't sure if I wanted to use this on my
      team, but I decided to try to catch it just in case... only to realize I
      only had one Star Ball left. I gave it a shot, but it broke free, so I
      decided I'd go back for more balls before delving too much deeper,
      especially if Rocken actually can be found here. On my way out though, I
      did find someone else I hadn't seen yet:

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>gwuh. huh whuh.</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      A good sprite, sure, but an unimpeachable all-time banger of a name. It's
      likely Rock, since it resisted Wrap, but it took neutral damage from Water
      Gun, so it could be Rock/Water, or potentially Steel. Its attacking move
      is Psywave, which is curious, althought not especially scary. It does hit
      Dark types despite being a Psychic move, which I guess shouldn't be
      surprising since Seismic Toss hits Ghosts in RBY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I ran back to Pewter to restock on Star Balls, I had enough cash for
      14 of them. While I was in the store though, one of the NPCs in the store
      shared a very interesting tidbit. This store sells Steely Genes, which hea
      says can be used to evolve "some bugs"... as well as Rocken! This tells me
      Rocken <i>has</i> to be somewhere close by, otherwise that NPC wouldn't
      have mentioned it. Plus, I've already got an item I can use to evolve it,
      presumably into Rockowt. Just when I thought I couldn't be more excited
      about adding one to my team.

      Back in the cave, I noticed a little change to the tileset where there's
      some discarded pickaxes on the ground. That's a neat detail. I can't
      identify the song used here, but it's fittingly dungeon-y. Who cares
      though, you're here to look at some new freaks, and I'm happy to oblige.

      It's a caveman, that's sensible. Another Rock type, which scans, but boy
      we're seeing a lot of new Rock types here. It's got Low Kick, which is bad
      news for my squad of Dark types, and it resisted Bite so it's probably a
      Rock/Fighting type.
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up the Water Gun TM here, which will do nicely against (most of)
      these Rocks. Mr. Bungle of course already has it, but Toby Kebel was also
      able to learn it. He wasn't using Poison Sting for anything anyways, so
      that's easy to drop. It's technically STAB but like... come on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Whirlies from that first cave are here as well, and I really cannot
      figure out what type these things are. They resist Normal moves, so they
      have to be Rock or Steel, but they took neutral damage from Thundershock
      and Bite. Most strangely, these things know not only Gust, which is weird
      on its own but also <i>Ominous Wind</i> of all moves. Next time I see a
      wild one I'll have to catch one and see, the one with Ominous Wind was
      from a trainer.

      Speaking of trainers with mons with weird moves, a Bug Catcher had a level
      15 Mulcrunch that one shot The Peeker with Bug Bite. I think The Peeker's
      stats are kind of ass, to be honest, and all these Cromags with Low Kick
      are not helping. It's just hands so it doesn't even have an ass, very
      impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least it can be carried by Wrap for now, and it did learn Karate Chop
      as well. You'd assume that since Gust was changed to be flying that Karate
      Chop would be Fighting as well: Nope, still Normal. Yeah Karate Chop was
      Normal in RBY as well, lol. In more exciting move news, Rowsdower learned
      Super Fang, which is incredibly exciting. Honestly right now he's got high
      enough damage output that most of his moves are dealing over 50% anyways,
      but I reckon the deeper we get into the game the more useful that'll be.
      In move news of equal excitement, The Don learned Leech Life, which I
      normally would not care about, but it seems like Leech Life is like, a
      real move in this game, it actually did decent damage when I used it. Bug
      doesn't beat Poison in this game any more though. That was a thing in RBY,
      in case you were curious, lol. Finally, in much less exciting move news,
      Mr Bungle learned Acid, which I might use one time, eventually, maybe, no
      promises.

      Well it's been long enough since we've seen a new Starbie, so how about

      It took me a second to figure out where I recognized this sprite from:
      It's based on
      <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tabitha">Tabitha</a>'s
      sprite from RSE. (Or just RE, I guess). This is a good sprite, the hood
      looks great, although out of all the things I could encounter in this
      dungeon that starts with "ROCKE", "ROCKET" is the one I wanted to see
      less. His team was Bokongo, Manhandla, and Whirlie, which gives some
      support to the "Manhandle is the Zubat equivalent" theory, although it's
      worth noting that there don't seem to be any in Mt. Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      After awhile I did finally find another Speakeasy, with some Star Balls in
      the tank I decided to catch one like I intended to do before.

    <p>
      Pibb Xtra (that's the nickname) is just gonna live in the box, but I did
      want to check what its type was: It's pure Fighting. I would've guessed
      Ground, since it looked a bit like a mole or something, but I don't know
      if that's actually what it's supposed to be. Is it a tiger? The Stardex
      entry says people call it a tiger, but that's probably just a figure of
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looks like there's some new encoutners on the lower levels of Mt. Moon, so
      even though Rocken didn't seem to be on the first floor it might be a
      Paras situation. Such as,

      Okay, I didn't actually introduce this thing with much fanfare, but I'm a
      massive fan of it. It looks like a Mega Man enemy, and I mean that in the
      nicest way possible. Under normal cirumstances, I might be more mixed on
      actually adding this to my team. However, those doubts were expelled when
      I saw its moveset included Glare. The more paralysis support we can give
      our team the better, and it's also got both Thundershock and Confusion, so
      it seems like it'll be able to come in on weakened foes and clean up
      pretty well.
    </p>

      I might be overthinking my team composition a little bit. But if I'm gonna
      commit to being The Wrap Team I'm gonna commit hard.

      Electric/Psychic is the type on this thing, which is pretty sweet. Psychic
      types definitely aren't quite as busted as they are in vanilla RBY since
      Dark and Steel types are around, but it's still good to have, especially
      since it can deal with Fighting types for our Dark Starbies. Epilepsia,
      you will hereby be known as X-Men Versus Street Fighter (XMVSF for short).
      Welcome to the team!

      With another Electric type on our team though, what will be the fate of
      Rowsdower, the Canadian Hero? It's still doing really incredible damage,
      so he's going to certainly stay on the team for now. However, he's
      definitely the next on the chopping block after I find a replacement for
      The Don. Which I think might be soon, if I can find who I'm looking

      kind of thought of a billion things, but my mind kept going back to that

      evolving this guy with the Steely Gene. So in that case, welcome to the

      It is at this point that I should come clean. The truth has come out, and
      I gain nothing by hiding it. I looked at the documentation for this next
      part. I know, I know! Not a blind playthrough any more! Or something.
      Look, in vanilla RBY when you evolve something using a stone it stops
      learning Level Up moves. I just wanted to make sure I wouldn't be screwing
      myself over by using the Steely Gene now, since Rocky Dan's moveset is
      currently just Tackle and Growl. It turns out, Rockowt (who is the Steely
      Gene metamorph) does in fact learn level up moves, but they are different.
      I didn't look too far ahead in detail, but there's one particular move
      that Rocken learns at Level 15 that I want to make sure I get before I
      evolve. So I was gonna need to grind a bit. And grind I did. I have
      included a video dramatization of this grinding below.

      This takes awhile since all I have to use is Tackle and I have to choose
      between Mt. Moon with a bunch of rocks and Route 3 with a bunch of Mach
      Punching Manhandlas. But I was determined to see it through for my boy.
      And see it through I did, to be rewarded with the worst best move in all
      of RBY.

      Beyond the fact that Sleep is even more busted than usual in RBY, it did
      feel wrong to have the Starbie that Sings without the move Sing. This is
      theoretically a nonbo with all the paralysis we have but like. Who cares.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that, we're ready to use the Steely Gene and have Rocky Dan
      ascend to his final form.

    <p>
      Just for reference, The Peeker's attack stat is currently 15. Rocky Dan is
      kind of a monster. Granted, he probably won't be as much help against the
      upcoming Water gym (assuming that's unchanged), but who knows, with this
      high of stats he might still be able to contribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also took some time to train up XMVSF for a bit, which was a lot easier
      since its Confusions hit pretty hard. Through levels it eventually learned
      Flash, which is kind of funny. It means I won't need to go out of my way
      to grab the Flash HM from the Aide before Rock Tunnel, but it also means
      I'll have 3 move slots until I reach the Move Deleter. Honestly the
      biggest impact this has on the game for me is that "STATS" is no longer
      the first option when selecting XMVSF in the menu, which is definitely
      gonna fuck me up every single time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about it now, it's kind of amusing that Rocky Dan becoming a
      Rockowt was actually the first evolution we saw in the whole game, even
      before our starter. I figured that was probably going to happen sooner or
      later though, and after a couple more uneventful trainer fights, that's
      exactly what happened.

      Not all that revolutionary of a design change, but it does the job. Mr.
      Bungle is now Water/Poison, which makes me moticably more likely to use
      Acid. Its Special and Speed are also now both much higher, with Speed
      obviously being especially nice for the Wrap strats.

      The hiker that stands in front of the ladder was actually a pretty notable
      fight here. He had a couple Starbies at the start of his lineup that
      weren't too scary but his last one was pretty annoying to take down.

      Mosston here seems to be Grass/Rock, which is not a type our team is very
      well set up to beat. Not only does its moveset have Screech to push lots
      of damage on any Beast I plan on leaving in for a long time, and even
      worse is Rest, which does a pretty good job at shutting down any Wrap
      based strategies since only miss is enough to let it heal back to full
      health (and they do so little damage that it's very likely that one will
      miss eventually since so many need to be used). Luckily, I just acquired a
      hammer, and this problem looks a lot like a nail, so Rocky Dan was able to
      take it down with some Screeches of his own (he learned Screech when he
      evolved btw). After two Screeches, even a not very effective Tackle did
      half of Mosston's health. Pretty brutal. The only downside to this
      strategy is both Starbies using Screech at each other was quite hard on
      the ears, since Screech in RBY has a pretty horrible sound effect.

      Just north of the hiker is a Moon Stone, which is in fact still a Moon

      be used for? (I did check my own party, nothing in there yet).

      The first Rocket in the basement got to show off that Nidorino expy we saw
      in the intro, Needolf. Unfortunately for its big debut, it doesn't seem
      like it has any moves that can damage a Steel type: It tried Poison Sting
      and Poison Fang on Rocky Dan but it didn't get very far. Or maybe it did
      have another move, and Team Rocket just isn't sending their brightest.

      After this fight, Rocky Dan learned Rock Throw, which I taught over
      Screech. If you had to guess how much accuracy Rock Throw has in RBY, what
      would be your guess? For reference, it was still 50 base power, and it was
      changed to 90 accuracy in GSC. If you guessed <i>65</i>, you're right, and
      probably also only know that because it's pretty ridiculous. I don't know
      if that number has been changed here, but even if it hasn't the potential
      to have STAB on this attack stat probably still makes it worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rockets don't put up much of a fight, beyond one of them having a
      Speakeasy with Slam which did actually hit pretty hard. Our last challenge
      is the Fossil Guy. Or should I say, the Soul Lady, since recall that these
      are "Souls" now, and this trainer has been changed to a Nerdette. Perhaps
      alluding to this change, her first Starbie is an Egg.

      All Eggerot got to accomplish was missing a Poison Gas before it just got
      Wrapped out of the game. This is still better than the fate suffered by
      her other two Starbies, who were both also new, and who both never got to
      take a single action since they were slower than The Peeker and I never
      missed a Wrap (I did use every single one of The Peeker's Wrap PP except
      for 1 in this fight though). This is the downside of the Wrap strategy, I
      suppose: I never actually get a chance to learn what any of these Starbies
      can actually do.

      After the fight, we of course get our choice between two souls; The Angel
      Soul or the Fiend Soul. This is another classic ROM hack move, they
      <i>love</i> doing Angel and Devil based creatures. (Remember those worms
      on strings from episode 0?) Since I don't want to go to hell, and since I
      was moderately more curious what it would look like, I picked the Angel
      Soul, and left the Nerdette with the Fiend Soul.

      Indeed, another guy in the back of the house is looking for a Manhandla,
      and wants to trade it for his Agahnoblin. Now, I do really want to see
      what this thing is. But even if The Peeker hasn't been the strongest
      member of our team so far, I'm also not sure I want to lose one of my Wrap
      users.

      So here's the plan: I'm gonna take a save state, we're gonna make the
      trade, and then if I decide I don't want to do it afterwards I'll just
      reload the save. Don't take it personally, The Peeker, I just want to see
      as many creatures as I can and I don't feel like walking all the way back
      through Mt. Moon to catch another Manhandla.

      Between Manhandla's dex entry all-capsing "THE ABYSS" and this one doing
      it to "LORD OF DARKNESS", it's really making me wonder just how far deep
      into ROM hack bullshit we're going to get by the end of this game. Maybe
      I'm setting myself up for disappointment, but if I can make one request
      for Star Beasts 3.0, it would be the ability to go to hell.

      it with some very ROM hack language and says it's “Meaner than my mum

      It was at this point I went go reload the save state that I'd made so I
      could get The Peeker back... Only to realize that I either forgot to make
      one or it didn't save correctly or something. Either way, my last save was
      right outside Mt. Moon just after I'd evolved Rocky Dan, so I had to do
      all of Mt. Moon over again. I'm choosing to believe that The Peeker took
      getting traded away really personally and so wanted to annoy me. It's got
      video game creepypasta powers after all, save states are a domain under
      its control. I'm sorry buddy, it won't happen again.

      Well, the trek back through Mt. Moon wasn't especially noteworthy,
      although I did get a lot more opportunities to use Rock Throw and see if
      it's accuracy has been changed at all: It doesn't seem like it, I was
      missing about half of the time. Pretty funny stuff. There is one last
      matter to attend to before we enter the city though: A TM on the ground,
      that will change the course of the playthrough.

      I was just thinking: "Rocky Dan is pretty busted for this point in the
      game right now, but the problem is he's not quite busted enough." Getting
      a TM for an incredibly powerful Steel move assuades those fears that I was
      definitely having, and nobody else on my team can learn it anyways. I
      considered removing Rock Throw instead of Tackle since it was so
      inaccurate, but it's important to consider: Rock Throw missing all the
      time is kind of funny. So Rock Throw stays. Oh, and there was nothing new
      in the tall grass on this route, other than wild Bokongos which we hadn't
      had the chance to catch yet.

      At least, here we are in Cerulean City. The music here is the Water Club
      theme from TCG GBC, which fits well but I do wish there was more original
      music and weirder choices, even if all of these tracks are great. I learn
      from some NPCs that Bill is in fact still Bill, and rather than a
      Pokémaniac they just call him a Collector. There's also an NPC that offers
      to trade a Spriggle for a Quincy: Having the other starters available as
      in-game trades is a cool way of doing it, I approve.

      From the person who explains what the badges all do, we also get to see
      what each of the badges has been renamed to. In order, the new names
      are:<br />
      • ROCKINBADGE<br />
      • SURFINBADGE<br />
      • MAGNETBADGE<br />
      • PRIDEBADGE<br />

    <p>
      After the first two I was really hoping they'd all be in the same "-'in"
      format, but oh well. Curiously the Marsh Badge looks to be unchanged. Is
      that gym's leader still going to be Sabrina? If so will this be lampshaded
      at all? This also poses the question of Team Rocket: The name of the last
      badge is different, is the boss still Giovanni? Stay tuned for the answers
      to all of these questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real reason to care about the badge man is that he's got a Rare Candy
      hidden in his backyard. Don't worry, that's still here and accounted for.

      Lawncrete here gives another name to a creature we haven't seen yet.
      Sounds to me like a Grass/Rock type, which would make the second one after
      Mosston, unless it's related. I guess it could also be Grass/Ground or
      something as well. In other news, an NPC that describes what Repels do

      Is the idea here that there's non-Star Beast animals and this is basiclaly

      This thing was kind of a major threat. XMVSF had a type advantage but its
      Thundershock would've been a 3 hit KO, and it was slower and got 2 shot.
      Mr Bungle tried to get some damage on the board, but didn't get very far
      either. Toby Kebel had to come in and show them how it's done. (Glared it
      and then clicked Wrap a bunch). After Tomaroc went down, his new Starbie
      was another new guy.

      Rumpel, who I would bet 20 dollars evolves into Stiltzkin, only used
      Teleport and then died. So I supposed it's the Abra expy. The Beast that
      came in next kind of really annoyed me though.

      Come on dude! That's my thing! You can't do my thing! He even used Wrap
      with it! It missed though, because he doesn't have the master's touch. He
      will never have the unbreakable bond that I have with The Peeker (except
      when the bond was broken for a little bit but shhhhh don't worry about
      it).

      The nameless, swagless, pathetic Manhandla went down fairly easily, as did
      the still unevolved Quincy that came out as his final Starbie. Quincy had
      Comet Punch which is kind of fun, that move getting wider distribution in
      the game called "Star Beasts" makes sense. After his miserable defeat,
      Varik mentions that Bill "seems like a kook" and that he turned himself
      into a Beast, saying "something about Gene Splicing". Seems like an odd
      piece of dialogue to add here, is that foreshadowing some kind of new
      mechanic? We're not gonna find out if we spend more time lollygagging
      here. Go home Varik, and take your miserable hands with you. The golden
      splendor of Nugget Bridge stretches before me, and your silly hat is
      blocking my view of its glory. (The glory is that I get a nugget at the
      end.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The trainers on Nugget Bridge were unremarkable: The Bug Catcher had a
      Slashopper which was kind of neat, but nothing cool otherwise. The music
      for this route starts with just percussion for a while, before its weirdly
      intense melody kicks in. I wouldn't mention this normally, but since I was
      entering into trainer battles so soon after I entered the route every
      time, I never actually heard the intense melody until I started talking to
      the Team Rocket guy at the end of the bridge, and it kicked in right as he
      started talking about Team Rocket. I initially mistook it for a dynamic
      music change to match the dialogue, but it wasn't, the song is just like
      that. Kind of funny.
    </p>
    <p>Anywho, the Rocket had this thing.</p>

      All time ROM hack banger right here. If I saw this thing when I was 13 I'd
      think it was the coolest shit in the world. Now that I'm 22 I also think
      it's still like, maybe the fourth or fifth coolest shit in the world. It
      still ranks. This thing had Shadow Claw which was interesting, but wasn't
      a Ghost since it took neutral damage from Wrap. Another Dark type,
      probably.

      The Nugget is great, but the really great item at the end of Nugget bridge
      is right here at the end:

      Thunder Wave is absolutely massive for our team, probably even better than
      the Flash Cannon TM I was popping off about earlier. A whole lot of my
      team can learn it as well: Toby Kebel, XMVSF, Rowsdower, and Mr Bungle are
      all options. Out of these XMVSF and Toby probably don't need it since they
      already have Glare, but I'll have to think on Rowsdower versus Mr Bungle.
      Having Paralysis on the thing you're using Wrap with in the first place is
      hugely beneficial, but it would also let Rowsdower actually contribute to
      the team's game plan more than just being big damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also feeds into another thing I've been thinking about: XMVSF has
      kind of been jobbing. Even its Confusions have not been hitting very hard,
      and its defenses are so low that it makes it hard for it to really make
      meaningful contributions in matches unless it's already got a type
      advantage against what's out. (And even then I got a Gen 1 miss with it
      against a fighting type earlier, lol). I haven't been using Rowsdower as
      much for a bit, since I was kind of thinking XMVSF might replace him on
      the team, but I think I'm taking him off the bench. Super Fang and that
      higher damage output sounds real good right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of Zapodi, the trek to Bill's house didn't have much to note,
      except for the fact that Rocky Dan's Flash Cannon is able to one-shot
      trainer's Zapodis even when it's supposedly not very effective. He's a
      monster, I love it.

    <p>
      Speaking of Steely Dan dealing huge damage, he tried to learn Selfdestruct
      after a level up here. Only other thing of note before we get to Bill's
      house is the Seismic Toss TM, which I doubt we're ever going to need so
      I'll probably just sell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bill's house, the scenario is basically the same as in RBY, although
      hilariously he's initially relieved that someone "came back" before
      realizing we're not that person and going "Ahem" and going into his usual
      dialogue. Varik just left him here I guess, fun bit of extra character.
      The only other notable change to his dialogue that I noticed was that he
      says "I can't stand rich folks" rather than "I can't stand fancy do's".
      That might just be because "fancy do's" is a slightly odd phrasing (which
      is the reason I remember the line in the first place), but I like to think
      the devs just wanted to add dialogue of someone saying they hate rich
      people. Hell yeah.

      In the entranceway to the secret garden is this guy, who says his Tearwulf
      thinks i'm a "bad person". in the dialogue, Stella apparently just says
      they are without any of my own input, which is honesty that he
      appreciates. I would've said I was a bad person either way for the record.

      We can go down these stairs to enter the garden itself, but we don't get
      very far before we're stopped by the cops. Apparently he isn't letting
      anyone through until "that creepy guy" is dealt with. I initially assumed
      he was talking about the weirdo with the werewolf, but since he's a cop
      he's actually probably talking about the Rocket who robbed the house.

      This guy also has honestly one of my favorite little pieces of dialogue in
      the game so far. He says that he's not letting anyone through until the
      creepy guy is dealt with and "things go back to normal. Well, normal by
      Cerulean City standards, anyways." That's such a fun little bit to add
      that makes the world feel so much more lived in. If you live in Cerulean
      weird shit and crime just happens a lot, apparently. It gives you that
      sense of worldbuilding while still feeling so natural. What a nice piece
      of flavor text. Big fan.

    <p>
      Before I returned to take on the gym, I decided to take a look in the tall
      grass in Route 24, which I didn't do the first time I had the chance.
      There's nothing we hadn't seen before as far as I could tell, but it is
      the first opportunity to catch some Beasts that only trainers have had so
      far: Rumpel and Sackran. Rumpel does have Teleport in the grand Abra
      tradition, but that's not actually its only move: It's also got Metronome.
      That's a much more fun gimmick than Abra, this would be a fun Starbie to
      raise. I think I'll pass for now though. Sackran is unsurprisingly Dark,
      and also has Teleport although it's in addition to a more normal moveset.
      The connection to the Mario RPG Crooks deepens: Those guys ran away from
      battle a lot too. Intentional reference? Probably not it's a common troupe
      for thief enemies in RPGs, but it's fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright, time to get ourselves a Surfin Badge. After a brief pep talk from
      the Gym Guide who tells us it's "totally radical", we've got a Swimmer and
      a Jr. Trainer to take down before the boss.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This Swimmer had an Infestin, who I'm pretty sure actually isn't a water
      type since Thundershock wasn't super effective. It's definitely Bug, since
      Rock Throw was super effective, so I'm not sure. When I fight some more of
      them I might try and check.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/jrtrainer.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The Jr. Trainer put up much more of a fight, with a Level 19 Jellyelly.
      Rowsdower's Super Fang is starting to really get some use now, against
      Starbies this bulky. Sure, it was still a three hit KO either way, but
      Super Fang and 2 Thundershocks is so much cooler than just using
      Thundershock 3 times. So consider that.

      Mizu's gimmick is that she's a surfer. Gym leaders in these games only get
      like 4 lines of dialogue total so that's the best you're gonna get. You're
      not here for rich characterization, you're here to see some little
      monsters. Case in point:

    <p>
      This sprite actually looks so good, the shading and stuff is so dynamic.
      It immediately landed a Sing on Rowsdower and got a 6-turn sleep, but I
      wasn't even that upset because I really liked looking at it. (I also got
      to listen to the Club Leader battle theme the whole time and I think I get
      less mad when I'm listening to that song. So maybe it was actually a
      genius decision.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowsdower was able to power through and wake up with the help of Splashee
      using a bunch of useless Mist, but he still had quite low HP so fell
      easily to a Bubblebeam from the next Starbie up.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Another great sprite, I assume from context this is Splashee's evolved
      form. It's got Powder Snow, which is kind of novel and would be real bad
      news if I was planning on countering this gym with a Grass type. If I
      can't use my Electric type though (and since XMVSF is warming the bench
      right now) we're going with the Wrap brigade on this one. The Peeker's
      Wrap, as ever, does quite low damage, so I needed some paralysis support
      from Toby Kebel to take this thing down. What I didn't expect was, after
      the Glare and getting a full paralysis afterwards, Toby Kebel just soloed
      the whole fight with Wrap and Inoyu never got to take another action. I
      need to stop doubting my GOAT.

    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/goatcoversation.png" />

      Despite functionally carrying the team, Toby Kebel was not the biggest
      benefactor of this gym victory. The Peeker, who barely contributed in the
      fight but did get swapped in at one point, score a Level Up off that
      experience. Which led to...

    <p>
      Gun to my head, I would start crying, as previously mentioned. But if you
      asked me what The Peeker was going to evolve into, even having seen
      Deathseer I never would've guessed they were related. My hands turned into
      a dog! This game's got so many dogs and now my hands are one of them! I'm
      not even upset it's just a bit odd. On evolution it also learned Shadow
      Claw, which I taught over Scratch.

      Alongside our badge we're also given the TM for Bubblebeam, which is
      another one that I'm a bit stumped on who I'll want to give it to. Mr.
      Bungle is an obvious choice, since it would be replacing Water Gun as a
      much more powerful STAB move, but I've also got a feeling he's going to
      learn a better water move by leveling up in not too long, and long-term
      he'll get access to Surf for sure. Toby Kebel, on the other hand, has been
      getting some good use out of Water Gun and might never get a chance to
      upgrade his Water coverage if I don't use this TM here. I think I'll wait
      a bit until we get some more levels to see if Mr. Bungle gets some better
      Water STAB, then I'll make the decision maybe after the 3rd gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other TM news, with that spectacular performance by Toby Kebel I
      decided I really did want to give Thunder Wave to one of my Wrap users,
      since that combination is just so deadly. I was planning on teaching it to
      Mr Bungle here, but on inspection, while it couldn't learn it as a
      Manhandla, The Peeker as a Deathseer actually can learn Thunder Wave. I
      waffled a bit on who should get it, but I think Mr. Bungle is probably
      going to wind up with better defensive stats by the late game than The
      Peeker, especially since Deathseer is the final evolution going by Stardex
      order, so Mr. Bungle needs the safety net a bit less. Plus, there's some
      novelty in The Peeker having it, imo. Sorry Bungle, I know I just denied
      two good TMs from you, but I promise there's a good reason for both.

      The last order of business here in the city is to run the Dig bandit out
      of town. He did show us one new Starbie for our troubles, which looks to
      be the evolved form of Rumpel. It isn't named Stiltzkin though, so I guess
      I'm out 20 dollars. All it had to attack was Confusion, so it put up no
      fight against a Dark type.

      In one of the more understatedly funny things to happen in RBY, the guy
      who was robbed and was upset about how much money he lost on having the
      Dig TM stolen doesn't even want it back when we recover it for him, since
      he just teached a Starbie named Cracture to use Dig without the TM. He
      couldn't done that the whole time, I guess. Just goes to show you,
      sometimes a tragedy is an opportunity. The next time you get robbed, just
      pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

      It was at this point, dear reader, that I realized what the music playing
      in this area was. It's, I kid you not, a chiptune arrangement of Blue (Da
      Ba Dee) by Eiffel 65. I mean, I guess it's just north of Cerulean City. So
      if you lived in Cerulean when this song was big you probably wouldn't hear
      the end of it. But it still really caught me off guard. You know what
      though? It's a lot more interesting than another TCG GBC tune, so I'll
      take it. Bring on the weird shit, that's what I'm here for.

    <p>
      After poking around in the grass for a bit, I didn't find anything too
      exciting, mostly a lot of Manhandlas. There's an NPC in here standing in
      front of a house, who says they come here to meditate. Did Bill let them
      in to do that? It doesn't seem like there's usually any security for this
      place beyond the cop who left after the robbery was solved. Unless the
      werewolf guy is supposed to be the security, but he thought I was a
      morally evil person and he still let me through, so who knows. The real
      main attraction of this secret garden is an overworld encounter, and as
      the dialogue before its fight says, it's "supposed to be pretty rare..."

      It's an Eevee horse! I'll bet you anything that's what this actually is,
      it's gonna have a bunch of item-evolving forms and everything. If that is
      what this is, then it should actually fit onto our team very well: We've
      got kind of an awkward selection of types right now, and I imagine we're
      going to continue swapping out team members at least a couple more times.
      If I just raise this horse alongside the rest of my team, once I have a
      final composition I can just evolve it into whatever form helps fill the
      gaps we have the best.

      I'm getting ahead of myself though, I don't even know for sure that's what
      this Beast's whole deal is. All I know is it's doing pretty huge damage
      with Horn Attack, so I might want it on my team over XMVSF just for that.
      Let's just catch it and we'll figure it out from there.

      Oh yeah baby, called it. Everyone please type "Wow Chill, you're so cool
      and talented and attractive" in the comments to shower me with praise for
      my superior deductive reasoning skills. We caught this little fellow in
      the secret garden of Eiffel 65, so there's only one nickname that makes
      sense to me. Welcome to the team

      I had to run away as fast as I could that was a very scary tiger. It
      jumped me in the tall grass as I was trying to leave and it was the most
      harrowing experience of my life. I'm sure all you chumps are gonna laugh
      it up but just think if you were in my shoes. If you saw an evil fire
      tiger coming out of a little hole thing you would be scared too.
