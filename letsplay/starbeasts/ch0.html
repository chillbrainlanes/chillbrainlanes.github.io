      Mario Kart DS is certainly not my favorite game in the series, but it
      probably makes my top 3. My favorite will always be Double Dash for its
      unique driving controls that just feel so great to play. Not to mention
      the two characters gimmick and bunch of karts give you so much more room
      for self-expression when you build your team, even with fewer characters
      than later titles, and the Special Items add so much fun and chaos as well
      as some strategy when you're choosing who you're playing as. For me, the
      only mark against Double Dash is the lack of content: Only 16 courses and
      no real frills. Mario Kart DS blows it out of the water in this regard,
      with 32 courses and a full mission mode with boss battles give you so much
      to do. For my money it's also potentially the best looking 3D game on the
      DS, and it has so many all time great tracks— Waluigi Pinball and Airship
      Fortress need no introduction.

      While any conversation with me is at risk of devolving into discussion of
      Mario Kart DS at any moment and for any reason, I actually do have a good
      excuse to bring it up here. It was in the comments section of
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvN2JPZXUJM&"
        >Big Yellow's Emmy-nominated Mario Kart DS stream VOD</a
      >
      that I was first introduced to Star Beasts, vis a vis this unassuming
      comment from pidesign8664:

      Glaring typo and 0 likes of this comment aside, the name of the hack
      mentioned here intrigued me. "Star Beasts". It didn't sound like it would
      be a <i>subtitle</i>, i.e. "Pokémon Star Beasts", so it seemed like it had
      to be something higher concept. That, plus it being particularly an RBY
      hack really intriguied me. At this point I was already tossing around the
      idea of doing a "Let's Play Thread" style event for December this year,
      and this sounded like it could be the perfect game to go into blind, if it
      really was as weird of an overhaul as it sounded like. (It was, on both
      accounts. But we'll get to that.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth of what Star Beasts actually was was something I don't think I
      ever would've predicted. As per

      If you're anything like me, you thought "dude that's fucking awesome"
      before you ever thought "hey wait a second what is Shi Kong Xing Shou".
      But that second question is still something that would have to cross your
      mind eventually. It turns out,
      <a href="https://antifandom.com/bootleggames/wiki/Shi_Kong_Xing_Shou"
        >Shi Kong Xing Shou</a
      >
      (or "Space-Time Star Beasts", which is probably what you actually should
      call the game in a vacuum, but I'm gonna keep calling it Shi Kong Xing
      Shou just so it's abundantly clear when I'm talking about the Pokémon hack
      versus the original game) is an unlicensed Taiwanese Game Boy
      monster-collecting game produced by the studio
      <a href="https://antifandom.com/bootleggames/wiki/Vast_Fame">Vast Fame</a
      >, who are evidently of some renown in bootleg gaming circles.

      I'm confident that I'll be given a lot of opportunities to talk about this
      throughout the next 25 days, but I really do have a great fondness for
      both ROM hacks and bootleg games. Really, they have a lot in common.
      Bootlegs tend to be a subject of derision, which you can tell just by the
      name. Laughing at amusing unlicensed Mario games found on random
      Famiclones is a time-honored internet passtime. Still, while there's often
      a lot of humor value in these titles, I don't think they're any less worth
      of genuine analysis, even praise when due, than games that are a part of
      the more traditional canon of the medium. When they were original titles,
      the developers and artists behind these games certainly put in just as
      much effort to create them. And even when they were hacks of existing
      titles, hacking a game, especially for translation, is no simple task, as
      I'm sure many creators of fan projects will tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some ways that's being a bit generous. Certainly many bootleg games
      were created simply to put another game with a recognizable character on
      shelves to trick potential buyers. Just as certainly, a lot of these games
      barely function at all. But, for one, if you really dig into the library
      of any game console you'll find plenty of official games that are about as
      fun and polished as the worst bootlegs. For another, for countless players
      around the world, their formative platforming memories came from
      <a
        href="https://antifandom.com/bootleggames/wiki/Mario_3:_Around_the_World"
        >Mario 4: A Space Odyssey</a
      >, or their first Pokémon partner was Kuribute from
      <a href="https://wiki.telefang.net/Pok%C3%A9mon_Diamond_and_Jade">
        Jade Version</a
      >. The experiences of those players aren't any less valid than those of us
      who played the official titles on official hardware. It's all video games,
      and I think there's something weirdly beautiful about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know exactly the impetus for Soul Valor and their team creating
      Star Beasts, but it's clear they have a deep appreciation for Vast Fame's
      work on Shi Kong Xing Shou. While the original game is certainly heavily
      inspired by Pokémon, it features an original roster of creatures, a unique
      story and characters, and distinct gameplay. If you hadn't known it was a
      bootleg, you'd have no reason to assume it was, which is really
      interesting. This team could've absolutely slapped an existing IP's name
      on this game and suffered no consequences. Vast Fame themselves did
      exactly that for several of their other games, including a Pokémon bootleg
      simply called "<a
        href="https://antifandom.com/bootleggames/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_(Vast_Fame)"
        >Pokémon Ruby</a
      >". (And other hackers did this to Shi Kong Xing Shou later as well, with
      a hacked version called "Harvest Moon 6" that just changes the title
      screen). But their commitment to creating something original, even if it
      that apparently borrows some assets and code from other games, really
      speaks to their genuine passion and ambition.

      If we're talking passion and ambition, we should turn to the more
      immediate matter at hand: ROM hacks. I've wanted to do some sort of
      article of series covering Pokémon ROM hacking on this website for quite
      some time. Earlier I was describing how a lot of people have genuine fond
      memories of playing bootleg games, and in truth I actually had a similar
      experience myself growing up, although it was mostly with watching YouTube
      videos of these hacks rather than playing them myself. Still, that's also
      all I was doing for every game released before Diamond and Pearl, so
      Pokémon Ruby Destiny, Quartz, Brown, Naranja, Ash Grey, Snakewood... They
      were all about as real to me as Crystal and Emerald were. There was a real
      sense of "anything goes" with ROM hacks back then. Everyone wanted to try
      and go more ambitious, with more involved storylines, more Pokémon from
      recent titles and/or more Fakémon. But, especially in hindsight, it all
      has a very charming amatuerish quality to it. You can always know "ROM
      hack writing" when you see it.

        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Really, when we think about these passion projects skirting around
      copyright laws to appeal to niches within niches, it's hard not to draw
      parallels to some of the most impressive "bootlegs" out there. The NES
      ports of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_(NES_video_game)"
        >Final Fantasy VII
      </a>
      and
      <a
        href="https://antifandom.com/bootleggames/wiki/Lei_Dian_Huang_Bi_Ka_Qiu_Chuan_Shuo"
        >Pokémon Yellow</a
      >
      come to mind, but Shi Kong Xing Shou almost certainly fits into the same
      category. It feels a little silly to say a Let's Play thread has a thesis
      statement, but if this one does have one it's this: Bootleg games rock and
      ROM hacks rock too. It's all video games, so it's all art, and weird
      fringe art is like the coolest kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I've kept y'all long enough, so let's dispose with all this preamble.
      I'm going into Star Beasts completely blind. I tried to avoid even looking
      into too much stuff about the original game so that I could be surprised
      by all the new critters. If you're reading this live, Episode 1 releases
      tomorrow!
