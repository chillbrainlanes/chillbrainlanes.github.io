    Our journey towards Fuschia City wound up being quite eventful, although it
    didn't start that way. The bridge with the Fishermen is about the same as it
    always was, although fighting them has really drawn attention to the fact
    that Sillish is the only actual fish in the game. After getting the Super
    Rod I was able to confirm, most of what I found while fishing were coffee
    monsters, clams, and.. water spirits? Whatever Splashee is supposed to be.
    One of the fishermen did have one new interesting Beast though: Judging by
    the name showing up as a Game Corner prize and it looking very Dragon-like,
    I'd wager good money that this is our Dragonite expy.

        >he desperately wanted to live, but he threw the watermelon that was
        worth tens of millions of yuan into niqiu's plate. let niqiu eat crazily
        and do nothing! even the villagers thought the man was stupid, i don't
        know if it's such a crazy behavior, but it made him earn hundreds of
        millions. it turned out that niqiu was born with a smell of mud, and the
        sweetness of the watermelon can be combined with it. he transferred the
        full niqiu to a big pot first, then he sprinked chicken feet on niqiu.
        under the stimulation of salt, niqiu's pain exploded in an instant, and
        he kept secreting mud from his body, but at this time the man didn't
        feel cool enough: he put on gloves and rubbed niqiu hard like rubbing
        clothes until niqiu was rub so hard that the skin of the niqiu was thin.
        he poured all the niqiu into the cleaner, add a caddy of flour and a
        little baking soda. under the merciless stirring of the machine, all the
        mucus in niqiu's body was washed out. this is the cleanest time since
        niqiu was born. the worker's aunt cleaned niqiu's internal organs by
        hand. after cleaning again, it can be fried directly in the oil pan
        until the five sides are golden. friends who have eaten niqiu know niqiu
        contains a variety of proteins needed by the human body. it has always
        been loved by male friends. as the saying goes, "it's better to eat
        niqiu on the ground then to eat it in the sky".</i

    Slobbix is blocking our path to proceed further, but luckily we have a Beast
    Flute to wake it up. After a Super Fang and a Hurricane from Rowsdower and a
    Thunder Wave from Tubi put it into perfect capture range, we catch the big
    man in our first ball.

    While I fight through more repetitive fishermen, I get a chance to use
    Sludge Bomb on Toby Kebel and admire its animation. Something I really
    admire about this game is its attention to detail on little elements of
    presentation like this. I think a lot of ROM hackers would've just given it
    the animation of Sludge and called that good enough (I've seen a lot of
    reused animations in other hacks), but this team put in the effort to give
    these moves unique animation, to the extent that if I didn't know better I'd
    assume Sludge Bomb was in the original game. It's great!
