    <p>
      I step foot into Fuschia City one time and I'm already being told lies.
      This guy in the Beast Center is trying to tell me that you need to train a
      large team of diverse Beasts to succeed, you can't just rely on one strong
      Beast. This is provably false by the number of children who beat any given
      Pokémon game by just powerleveling their starter. I will not stand for
      this disinformation.

      I'm so mad. I'm gonna go to the zoo so I stop being mad. And I'm gonne
      look at this thing.

    <p>
      The zoo's got a couple other interesting tidbits: Malevolos is apparently
      revived from the Fiend Soul, which makes it a little bit less special
      since we've seen so many trainers with them. I'd guess that the Angel Soul
      probably is revived into that little angel looking Beast whose name I
      forget. You know the one. To me surprise, there's also a Vulturnus on
      display, which makes me think it might not actually be "legendary" in the
      Pokémon sense? Maybe it's just rare. In any case, it's apparently "The
      fastest Starbie in the world!" and it can "Throw one hundred punches in
      the blink of an eye!"

      One last new Beast at the zoo, this also happens to be what the Safari
      Warden's friends have nicknamed him instead of Slowpoke.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/tongoron.png" />

    <p>
      Not much else to talk about in the city itself, so we might as well just
      head into the Safari Zone and get our Surf HM and Gold Teeth. My plan
      going in was to try and catch anything that I didn't already have the
      Stardex entry for, since the more of those we can read for free the
      better. Unfortunately, this didn't really work out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a list of every Safari Zone encounter I got, across both the grass
      and fishing: Slashopper, Inoyu, Speakeasy, Deathseer, Kurayami, Slimogg,
      Jelleye, Climpale, Rekall, Needolf, Pyrodon. You may notice that, besides
      those last three, I already own every single one of these Beasts. I just
      kept perfectly running into Starbies whose dex entries I already had, it
      was kind of astounding. And out of those last three, every single one I
      threw one Ball or Rock and they ran away immediately. And this was aross
      two attempts! On my first attempt I ran out of steps before I was able to
      get to the HM, because I was foolish enough to assume that a "Rest House"
      meant my step counter wouldn't decrease while I was inside it. Boy, that
      sure was worth it to get to read this guy's dialogue.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >okay to be fair i do actually appreciate that the police thing didn't
          get completely dropped after we left the route, there was another
          officer walking around the city too</i
        >

    <p>
      Well, whatever. We got Surf and we got the Gold Teeth to trade for
      Strength. Zorotl obviously learned Surf over Bubblebeam, but I was shocked
      how many of the rest of my team could also learn it. Tubi could,
      naturally, but so could both Toby Kebel and Rowsdower. Toby might as well
      pick it up over Bubblebeam himself, but Rowsdower really surprised me.
      That would be nice to smack Ground types. I ultimately decided against it,
      since Hurricane gives me a type I don't have much coverage for otherwise
      (although Falcon Punch is arguably all I really need) and Super Fang has a
      lot of utility against anything that's really tanky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strength though, was a bit of a question mark. With Cut and Flash being
      turned into real moves, I was wondering if Strength would become something
      like a Rock or Fighting move. I was really hoping for Fighting, since I
      think that's the one type our team could really use the most. I was going
      to have to teach it to something, though, and there's no move deleter in
      RBY so there's no take backs. Out of our current team, Tubi would be both
      well positioned to use a good Fighting move and also can bear the weight
      of a bad move if that's what it winds up with, so I decided to get rid of
      Recover. To my delight, it is in fact Fighting in this game, and also has
      a 10% chance to drop the target's Speed. These two HMs actually represent
      such a huge upgrade to our team.
    </p>
    <p>
      So hey, remember those two trainers that were talking in gibberish, and we
      had that parenthetical flavor text about being unable to understand them?
      And there was another guy on that route who called them "cult members"?
      Well, like I suspected from the "Nepu Badge", this Gym is actually just
      <i>formerly</i> Fuschia City Gym: Now it's the Neputail Fan Club.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/ratqueen.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >as we'll learn, she's not actually the queen of multiple rats, just
          the one rat</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Inside, the <s>Gym</s> Fan Club seems to be a maze of narrow passages,
      filled with gravestones. Speako's pretty creeped out by it, and
      understandably so.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/hate.png" />

    <p>
      Every dead end is marked by a trainer, who all have something to say about
      Neputail. According to them, there is only a person born who can control
      Neputail once in a generation, which explains why all these so-called
      Neputail fans don't even have any of them on their team. There do seem to
      be multiple, from the way these NPCs talk about them ("The wizard that
      would become the first Neputail stole a jewel that gave it magical
      powers!"), but Ivy only has one. So I guess the rest are just free to roam
      the wilderness since there's nobody that can control them.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/wizard.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >oh yeah i kind of glossed over the wizard thing but that's kind of
          hype</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      What kind of surprises me about this whole section of the game is how...
      normal? All of the NPCs seem? Like they're all big fans of Neputail, but
      they're not actually acting very cult-like in the traditional fantasy
      sense. They've even got a sense of humor about the whole thing: One NPC
      says "Neputail... I have failed you!" after being defeated, but talking to
      him again he says "I don't think Neputail cares that I failed, but it sure
      sounded cool, didn't it?" When I heard the dialogue back then about the
      "cult members", I did float the idea that maybe the guy meant it more
      sarcastically rather than as a serious description, and I'm kind of 50/50
      on whether that's actually how you're supposed to read what's going on
      here. Then again, we are in a maze of gravestones, so maybe my
      expectations of Snakewood-level edgy nonsense were just too high.
    </p>

      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/language.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >there is also still one trainer who speaks "the ancient language of
          Neputail!" as well so like. yeah idk probably still a cult but they're
          not thaaaat weird about it</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Oh yeah and before I forget, the guy who said he failed Neuptail looked
      like this. I happen to know off the top of my head that this is the sprite
      for the unused Sprinter trainer class from the Gold and Silver Space World
      '97 beta, a fact that's taking up space in my brain that I could spend
      remembering the names of my high school classmates or the date of my
      parents' anniversary.
