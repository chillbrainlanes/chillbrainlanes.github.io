    <p class="centertext bigtext">Episode 21: Wizard Duel</p>
    <p>
      The trivia machines in Blaine's Gym always say that you want to get the
      trivia questions right so you can "preserve your Pokémon for the Gym
      Leader" by not fighting trainers. Obviously, you can just leave, heal, and
      come back, which makes this not actually matter at all. Just for fun
      though, I decided I would play by the Gym's rules this time, and not heal
      at all throughout the entire Gym while still fighting every single trainer
      and the Gym Leader in one go. Obviuosly I still wanted to read the trivia
      dialogue though. After everything in the Mansion, I wanted to make sure I
      wasn't missing any dialogue about this dude.

      The first question was quite simple: "Cupeedle evolves into Velociflea?"
      Technically there's a stage in the middle there, but I assumed that didn't
      count for this, and I was correct, the answer was Yes. From here though,
      the questions and the dialogue of the trainers shifts into talking about
      the "Four Holy Regents", which seem to be the group of Beasts that was
      mentioned in the Mansion Diaries. "Sivak the Black Dragon wanted to be
      free from entropy, so he betrayed the other three Holy Regents. They say
      he was so ashamed over what he had done, that he hid away from them,
      forever." Seems like the lab might be tied into this whole situation too,
      with the suspicious mention of "entropy" here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next question even expounds upon this: "Does our soul resurrection
      technology work on humans?" I said Yes to this one, since I didn't want to
      look like an idiot if that was the answer, but it is in fact No. As a
      matter of fact, "Velid was trying to find out how to make humans like us
      immortal! That's why he spent so much of this life looking for the Four
      Holy Regents."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he did call one or more of the regents "GOD" in all caps in one of
      the diary entries, the answer to "The Four Holy Regents did NOT create
      this world?" was Yes. Real dick move to make this a double negative, by
      the way, especially since it would have to be a guess either way. "Nobody
      really knows what the FOUR REGENTS are...", and the Robber trainer for
      this question doesn't even seem to think they're real. You're a criminal,
      dude, I thought you'd love cons.

    <p>
      "Is Velid NOT over two hundred years old?" follows up that last double
      negative question. He is, evidently, so the answer here is No. "Velid used
      to be an alchemist, a man of both science and magic!" He "devoted his life
      to helping others with his research, but then he saw... Something. And
      legends say he was never the same, after that." That seems to me like an
      odd way to describe an alchemist, but I guess I see the vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Velid one of the very last wizards alive today?" He is, but I wonder
      if we'll ever meet a second one in the Elite Four or anything. This is
      further Wizard lore after Neputail, which I wasn't really expecting but
      makes me wonder how much of this setting's worldbuilding has been sketched
      out. Is there a rich lore document that the devs maintain, or is this just
      all off the cuff? Either way is cool, honestly. If there is a lore
      document, I really want to see if it includes anything on this last
      question:

    <p>
      "Do you believe that Hell isn't real?" I said Yes, assuming that would be
      wrong, but the wording of the question is very poor. It should really just
      say "Is Hell real?", since as-written it's asking me what my belief is. If
      it is True that I believe Hell isn't real, answering Yes should be correct
      whether or not it's actually real, because that's not what the question
      asked. This is the only bad part about Star Beasts. Everything else is
      perfect but I would change this one thing. But it is pretty entertaining
      comedic timing to get this question wrong and then have this NPC walk up
      and say "Hell is real." After the battle, she mentions that every once and
      awhile Velid will wake up screaming in the middle of the night about the
      things he saw, but none of the gym trainers can do anything to help him.
      This does make me wonder where Velid and the rest of these people sleep
      and what their relationship is, but it's a cute detail to mention stuff
      like this that suggests these NPCs having life outside where we see them
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      If not for all of this stuff in the rest of the gym, I'd assume Velid's
      gimmick about being a Wizard was just for show. He says he's going to
      "make our Star Beasts disappear!" and all that. But even his title is
      "MANCER" so it sure seems like he's the real deal.

      Our team wasn't beaten up too much, but we had a couple Beasts at half
      health going into this. Rocky Dan was pretty well beat up since his
      Earthquakes were carrying me through most of the gym trainers, but he was
      able to do well against Verbeden, which was Velid's lead. I can almost
      guarantee you don't remember what Verbeden is, so I'll share an extra
      image just this once.

    <p>
      After taking out Verbeden, Rocky Dan wanted to learn Explosion. At this
      point I had gone through the entire Fire gym without using Rock Throw even
      once, and I was fairly convinced I was never going to actually want to use
      it again. So I figured, what the hell, let's get Explosion in here. If for
      no other reason than I wanted to see if it had a new animation like
      Selfdestruct did. With this low of health, I figured I should just use it
      right now anyways, and his next Beast seemed like as good of a target as
      any.

      Beourgeist went down to Zorotl easily, since I was preserving him with
      full health in the back this whole time. A Level 47 Nocean is his ace
      Beast, and I was no longer laboring under the assumption that it resisted
      Water, so even without super effective damage Zorotl easily won this final
      1v1.

      Velid comments that he "likes our style" and bestows unto us the
      PyroBadge, as well as the TM for Fire Blast. He mentions that it's the
      ultimate Fire technique, but oddly mentions to not "waste it on a Water
      Star Beast!" Does that imply there's a bunch of Water types that learn it?
      Upon doing some research this is actually the same dialogue Blaine gives
      you after he gives you the TM, so I actually have no clue what they were
      getting at there.

      Well, with 7 out of 8 badges claimed, there's only one last Gym to
      conquer. How funny would it be if Lucian isn't even the Gym Leader there
      and it's just some other person. In case you're wondering, I don't have
      any plans right now to go out and hunt for these legends, assuming they're
      in the same spots as the birds and Mewtwo, but if there's interest I might
      do some sort of bonus episode later. Let me know in the comments if you
      want to see that.
