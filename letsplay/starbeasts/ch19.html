    <p class="centertext bigtext">Episode 19: The Value of Persistence</p>
    <p>
      Just outside Fuschia we see a couple of cops slacking off, who are not
      particularly enthused by a kid showing up and "busting" them for standing
      around in a patch of grass on the job.
    </p>

      Evidently these guys are pissed that the "new boss" is "forcing us to
      actually do our jobs!" I wasn't really expecting this plot to be followed
      up too much after that route, but we've seen reference to it both here and
      in Fuschia proper, so I guess it's supposed to be a pretty big part of
      this middle-end part of the game. Not really a complaint, but it would've
      been cooler if there were a lot of these smaller subplots rather than just
      one that spans multiple areas, imo. It does make the world feel more
      connected, but too much of it risks making it feel a bit one-note.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's actually two new Beasts among these cops' teams, which is pretty
      surprising since there were almost no new Beasts in the all of Fuschia
      that I could tell.

      To the west of these guys is the gate to Cycling Road. Attentive viewers
      may remember that, although we did get the Bike Voucher, we never actually
      went back to Cerulean to get a Bicycle. There was certainly a chance I'd
      have to backtrack back there to get it, but there's a glitch in RBY here
      that I really wanted to see if it had been patched or not: If you just
      keep trying to walk through the Cycling Road gate, eventually you'll
      successfully be able to just scoot yourself one extra tile and walk past
      the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folks, not only is this glitch not patched, it's actually
      <i>even easier</i> in this game due to the Run button. In fact, I found
      that as long as you're line up with the topmost row of tiles, if you're
      running directly to the right it's actually completely conistent, meaning
      it's also a lot easier to do by accident. Funny stuff.
    </p>

      While I'm talking about things attentive viewers may have noticed: We're
      at the bottom of Cycling Road, not the top. It's a lot more annoying to
      climb the hill than it is to go down it, but I wanted to make sure I saw
      all of the NPCs and dialogue here, so I was determined to bike through.
      And I'm glad I did too, because this is (presumably) the final punchline
      of the Sabrina plot.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/bikechanneler.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Seems like everyone from Sabrina's gym has taken up residence in Cycling
      Road, since the Bikers have taken over the gym. There's not really much of
      an explanation provided for this: This channeler says that "A wizard did
      it! A.... spooky bicycle wizard! Yeah." We have no other option than to
      take this at face value.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/beourgeist.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >oh and one of the channelers had the evolution of that candle
          thing</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Here we also see Psychics, a class of trainer who we'd never actually get
      to see in-game if not in Sabrina's gym, so good on them for squeezing in
      here.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/psychic.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >this guy was actually the first trainer i encountered on cycling road
          and i didn't put together the "these people are all from sabrina's
          gym" thing until i saw the channeler</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      There's only a couple of Psychics on the route, and none of them actually
      have bikes. There's a couple other NPCs further up the road who don't have
      bikes either. I'd ask how they were allowed onto Cycling Road without
      them, but I guess I was allowed in without any trouble so fair play to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Couple other NPCs of note: There's two non Psychic gym members here, one
      Cue Ball who's really freaked out by the Channelers and initially thinks
      you're one of them, and one unrelated Gambler who mentions getting lucky
      at the Game Corner and has a team of 6 Beasts you can get as Game Corner
      prizes. (Rumpel, Xiaolong, Dragleam, Flewnicorn, Cheppi, and Robby.)
      That's a fun gimmick I like that. There's also a Psychic with the
      post-match dialogue "I was astral projecting into the ocean, and having a
      damn good time, until YOU came along!" Which is just a bit amusing.
    </p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>
      At the top of the hill is a group of Channelers that mention the stuff
      about getting kicked out of Sabrina's gym much more explicitly, which is
      sensible since most players are going to encounter them first. I didn't
      though, because I'm not very smart. One of them did have the evolution of
      Malevolos though: It's still so odd to me that so many trainers have these
      on their teams if they're supposed to be the fossil equivalents. Not a
      choice I would've made.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Only other thing worth mentioning on Cycling Road is that The Peeker
      learned Super Fang. Would've been nice to have on this guy over Rowsdower
      for the early game, considering Rowsdower's damage output did not need the
      help while The Peeker's definitely did, but it's better late than never.
      (And I suppose it would've have made much sense back when The Peeker was
      Hands instead of a dog.) After the embarassing performance acgainst
      Shayton I've also really been meaning to get rid of Mach Punch. While the
      mental image of a my evil dog knowing martial arts was very funny, it was
      just never a move that accomplished anything when I used it.

      At the other gate you'll be happy to know that the old man NPC can still
      walk through the wall. I was considering just waiting around and checking
      to see if this could happen manually, but it just happened by chance the
      first time I walked through. Great day for Cycling Road entrance gate
      glitches.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Going by this game's track record with this stuff, I half expected this
      guy's dialogue to lampshade being able to walk through that wall. Instead
      it's just another hint: "Use a DARK SOUL on TOMAROC. Thank me later." I
      continue to appreciate these hints, but if I was using a Tomaroc on my
      team until I was this level and only just now saw this NPC I would've been
      pretty annoyed, lol. You can go here a lot sooner than I did though, so
      that's not a complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of birds, we might as well grab the Fly HM while we're in the
      area. Same dialogue here, but she seems to have a better reason for hiding
      away from all of society if her partner Beast looks like this. Because
      it's ugly. The joke is that I think it's ugly.

      I suppose now it's time to head for Cinnabar Island. The most direct path
      would probably be surfing off the coast of Fuschia, but now that we have
      Surf and Strength I really want to see what's up with that cave part of
      Cracture Chasm. So we can walk back to Vermillion, go through the Chasm to
      get to Viridian, go south back to Pallet, tell our mom we love her like
      Varik asked us to, and then surf south from there to reach Cinnabar. Man,
      Kanto is such a fun region to wander around for being from the first game.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's two different ladders downwards in the chasm. However, one of them
      is blocked off by a Strength boulder that's directly in front of a body of
      water. It doesn't seem like we're able to push this into the water or
      anything, so I think this is some kind of shortcut out of here that you
      have to push from the other side.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

          all the way to the right you'd still be stuck. so i don't know what
          the deal is here</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The other ladder is completely open though, and it's home to some manner
      of strange creature.

      "Before you is some sort of FIEND from an era long forgotten. It spots you
      and growls, taking up a fighting stance." It's a Malevolos! Maybe all
      those trainers that had them just got them from this cave? And maybe that
      Strength boulder is blocking the entrance to the other fossil Beast, and
      the boulder just gets placed there based on what fossil you choose, and
      it's a Strength boulder because that's an object and not a map tile so it
      can be dynamically moved around like this? That's what I'm going with. In
      any case, I caught the Malevolos without much trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      Are HELL and THE ABYSS different places? Are either of them home to the
      DARK LORD? Is it the place we went in that house in Celadon? I dunno, but
      this game's use of all caps on certain words is actively hilarious and I'm
      a big fan of it.
