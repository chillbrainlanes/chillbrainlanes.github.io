      Our journey towards Fuschia City wound up being quite eventful, although
      it didn't start that way. The bridge with the Fishermen is about the same
      as it always was, although fighting them has really drawn attention to the
      fact that Sillish is the only actual fish in the game. After getting the
      Super Rod I was able to confirm, most of what I found while fishing were
      coffee monsters, clams, and.. water spirits? Whatever Splashee is supposed
      to be. One of the fishermen did have one new interesting Beast though:
      Judging by the name showing up as a Game Corner prize and it looking very
      Dragon-like, I'd wager good money that this is our Dragonite expy.

          worth tens of millions of yuan into niqiu's plate. let niqiu eat
          crazily and do nothing! even the villagers thought the man was stupid,
          i don't know if it's such a crazy behavior, but it made him earn
          hundreds of millions. it turned out that niqiu was born with a smell
          of mud, and the sweetness of the watermelon can be combined with it.
          he transferred the full niqiu to a big pot first, then he sprinked
          chicken feet on niqiu. under the stimulation of salt, niqiu's pain
          exploded in an instant, and he kept secreting mud from his body, but
          at this time the man didn't feel cool enough: he put on gloves and
          rubbed niqiu hard like rubbing clothes until niqiu was rub so hard
          that the skin of the niqiu was thin. he poured all the niqiu into the
          cleaner, add a caddy of flour and a little baking soda. under the
          merciless stirring of the machine, all the mucus in niqiu's body was
          washed out. this is the cleanest time since niqiu was born. the
          worker's aunt cleaned niqiu's internal organs by hand. after cleaning
          again, it can be fried directly in the oil pan until the five sides
          are golden. friends who have eaten niqiu know niqiu contains a variety
          of proteins needed by the human body. it has always been loved by male
          friends. as the saying goes, "it's better to eat niqiu on the ground
          then to eat it in the sky".</i

      Slobbix is blocking our path to proceed further, but luckily we have a
      Beast Flute to wake it up. After a Super Fang and a Hurricane from
      Rowsdower and a Thunder Wave from Tubi put it into perfect capture range,
      we catch the big man in our first ball.

      While I fight through more repetitive fishermen, I get a chance to use
      Sludge Bomb on Toby Kebel and admire its animation. Something I really
      admire about this game is its attention to detail on little elements of
      presentation like this. I think a lot of ROM hackers would've just given
      it the animation of Sludge and called that good enough (I've seen a lot of
      reused animations in other hacks), but this team put in the effort to give
      these moves unique animation, to the extent that if I didn't know better
      I'd assume Sludge Bomb was in the original game. It's great!

      I'm gonna have a lot of praise of this game on this route, actually. We'll
      get there though, first we fight a Cue Ball who has all Electric type
      Beasts. After the battle, we suggest he use his bald head as a solar
      panel. That's pretty good. I guess me thinking that gag is pretty funny is
      also praise, but not what I was getting at.

      Most of the other NPCs on the bridge area aren't particularly notable.
      There's a Fisherman who gives us a couple spots where you can catch wild
      Jelleye, evidently in addition to the Safari Zone they can also be found
      fishing in certain routes with the Super Rod. There's also a patch of
      grass behind a cut tree with nothing really new in it, but I did happen to
      catch a glimpse of another new cave entrance. Can't get back there from
      here, but presumably we'll be able to go around later.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      From this point on, it seems like just about every trainer on this route
      has new dialogue, since there's a new little story beat going on here. Our
      first hint of that comes from this NPC, who says her friend can't stop
      fawning over a police officer.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/becky.png" />

      They're standing just nearby, and they're both trainers who we have to
      fight. The cop is none too pleased about having to deal with this girl,
      and is thankful for us showing up just to have something to do.

        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Oddly, the Officers have their own unique battle theme. It took me a
      second to recognize the tune, but it seems to be an arrangement of Flash
      Man's theme from Mega Man 2. It's slowed down, and played in a more
      straight rhythm, but it's recognizably the same song. I'll grant them
      that, when slowed down like this, it does sound like the theme song for a
      cop show. But it's a little odd they felt the need to give them their own
      song at all. I guess they are a pretty big part of this little section of
      the game though, as we'll see.
    </p>

        <i>so uh, does she fall into the 41%</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The two Beauties in the maze-like section of the route from the original
      game have some new dialogue that gives a hint about what's going on here.
      One of them says that Officers are hot and that her friend who likes
      Bikers has no taste, with the other saying the opposite. The one who liked
      the cops has a Norhorse though, so I know who I'd call lacking in taste.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i

          this route</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Indeed, this route sounds like it's normally teeming with Bikers, but with
      the Shayton situation, there's been a massively increased police presence
      to try and keep them from causing any more trouble. The Bikers who are
      still around are bemoaning the presence of all the cops and calling
      Shayton a dumbass, meanwhile most of the cops seem to be incredibly bored
      since none of the Bikers are actually doing anything illegal.

      Oh one of the cops who says he's "bored out of his mind" after his battle
      starts the battle by quoting the Sans fight intro from Undertale to you,
      word for word, except for changing the last bit. I was gonna do an edit of
      a cop wearing a shirt that said like "I'd Rather Be Playing The Classic
      2015 Indie RPG Undertale Right Now" but I didn't want to give him too much
      credit.

    <p>
      I absolutely adore what they did with this area in this game. Something
      I've always kind of felt about the early Pokémon games is that most of the
      areas don't feel very connected to what's around them. There's a bunch of
      NPCs doing their own thing, and maybe they'll drop a line like "hey have
      you fought this Gym Leader?" or something like that. But it never really
      feels like the things you do in one area really affect the areas around
      it, and almost none of the side characters have any impact on the world of
      anyone in it outside of the very small area you encounter them in.
      Parallel to that, a lot of generic "Routes" in the games can struggle to
      have much of their own identity. There's plenty of memorable locations to
      be sure, but it generally comes from geography rather than the people and
      dialogue, who often times feel a bit disconnected. With both of these
      problems combined, it feels like most of the dialogue you're reading in a
      Pokémon game doesn't feel like characters in a world, it just feels like
      they had to write some random words to put in front of some RPG battles. I
      wonder if this is why so many people just skip through all the dialogue in
      these games all the time, 9 times out of 10 it just adds nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, Star Beasts has done a great job making random NPC trainers
      actually have worthwhile things to say. Sometimes they're alluding to
      future events or characters, sometimes they're giving you gameplay hints
      like where to find or how to evolve various Beasts, sometimes they're just
      pretty entertaining jokes. But it feels like it lets a lot less of its
      text go to waste, and this area is a perfect example. I could've have told
      you what anyone in this area was talking about in the original game, but
      here there's not only a little mini-story unfolding, but it's also
      directly related to something that we saw happen in a different area. It
      goes such a long way to making the world feel more genuinely lived in.
    </p>

      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/icequeen.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">

    </figure>
    <p>
      We haven't actually seen the final beat of this story yet, although we do
      have this cop alluding to there being an "Ice Queen" that's stopping them
      from leaving. But before we deal with that, there's still one more matter
      to attend to on this route.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/intocave.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>oh boy, i can't wait to spelunk an awesome cave area</i>

      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>oh nevermind</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      So the cave is actually a forest. Alright, whatever. There's some grass
      here with nothing really newsworthy, but a couple other things that are
      pretty notable. One is just some old lady, who stands here offering an
      in-game trade with the normal default dialogue. I have no idea why she's
      here in this secret forest, but she's looking for a Slaymore and offering
      to trade an Auraklos, so it seems like you'll be able to get the other
      Dojo prize through a trade for completion's sake.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/slaymoretrade.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >the mysterious forest is the perfect place to wait for someone who
          might want to trade star beasts with you. keep it up</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This forest is pretty small, there's a branching path right at the start,
      with the left side leading to the old lady and the right side leading down
      a slightly more winding path to the main attraction: What seems to be a
      Legendary Beast! (Not to be confused with the Legendary Beasts from
      Pokémon).

      The full quote here is "Before you stands a Vulturnus, one of the
      legendary guardians of the winds. In the time it takes you to process its
      presence, it has already attacked you! It feels like a typhoon!" I did
      drop a save before the fight, not really so much because I was worried
      about accidentally KOing it, but mostly because I only have like 3 regular
      Star Balls in my inventory and nothing else. So I'm probably just going to
      come back for this thing later, maybe in some sort of big roundup of all
      the legendary locations near the end of the game.

      It seems to be a Fighting/Flying type, which would be an appealing
      replacement for Tubi that can deal with Steel types nicely. But I didn't
      catch it in my balls that I had, my team was pretty beat up from all the
      trainers, and I didn't feel like just resetting over and over again until
      it got caught. So we'll leave it until later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back out to the route for more battles, just a couple other things
      to note. Rekall can learn Transform apparently, so that's cool. Also I
      actually got to use the Beast Flute to wake up something that was asleep,
      I'm glad I remembered it can actually do that, lol. There is one more new
      Beast on an Officer's team that we hadn't seen before, although its name
      has showed up a couple of times.

    <p>
      Like I briefly mentioned earlier, my team was pretty well beat after
      fighting all the trainers on this route. Luckily, if you know the layout
      of this route, there's a ledge you can walk on top of until just before
      the Fuschia City gate, so I could just sneak past the rest, heal in the
      city, and then come back. Unfortunately, there's still an "Ice Queen" to
      deal with.

      It's Lorelei! This is kind of the perfect capstone to talking about how
      side characters in early Pokémon games feel pretty flat. For the longest
      time, the Elite 4 were the thing the whole game was leading up to, but you
      had no idea who they were. And not in like a "building up a mystery" sort
      of way, they were just a bunch of randos. If these are gonna be our final
      bosses, they should have some personality! In RBY, all we really got was
      Agatha potentially having some history with Oak. Having Lorelei here,
      acting as a police chief and being a boss of this little side story, is a
      really cool choice!

      What I'm less of a big fan of is my team being beat to shit before this
      fight. I'm gonna need to get creative if I'm gonna take down a boss with a
      team of 5. Oh, and fittingly with the Gym Leaders having the Club Leader
      battle music, Lorelei (and presumably the Elite 4 as a whole) has the
      Grandmaster battle theme.

      Her first Beast out was a Tinieddi wih was able to paralyze Zorotl with a
      Body Slam on its first attack. It went down to two Bubblebeams either way,
      but that set me up for a frustrating matchup against her second Beast.

    <p>
      On its first turn out, Hellbrand proceeded to outspeed Zorotl and hit him
      with a Confuse Ray. Every turn after that, it went for Headbutt, making
      for a 3-way "you can't move this turn" combo with paraflinchfusion. If
      that wasn't enough, The Peeker, who came out next, caught a Burn off its
      Ember (it seems to be Ice/Fire since Bubblebeam was super effective), so
      that throws a pretty big wrench in our Wrap game plan, and I've also only
      got 1 PP of Crunch left, which I spent to knock this little stinker into
      next week. The Peeker hit the next Beast in with a Thunder Wave, but I had
      to tag out after that.

      Under normal circumstances, Rocky Dan and Tubi's Flash Cannons would be
      able to make quick work of a team full of Ice Starbies. Unfortunately,
      Tubi's out of comission, and Rocky Dan's paralyzed, has less than a
      quarter of his HP left, and only has two PP of Flash Cannon left. Still,
      that's enough to take down Swiftile and Mandolin, who came in afterwards.
      Only one Beast now stands between us and finally getting a chance to heal.

      Here, I was pretty sure Rock Throw would either be a one or two shot, but
      full paralysis makes things tricky. I decided to go for a Sing, which I
      thought would give me more turns to try and land two Rock Throws. I did
      land it, but in hindsight I was just as likely to land Sing as I was a
      Rock Throw so I probably should've just gone for that. I was not rewarded
      for this, I did get six turns of sleep, but in those turns I got one hit,
      two full paralysis, and three misses, and I was knocked out by Crunch. (I
      barely survived the first Crunch on the turn I used Sing). Luckily,
      Rowsdower is busted and his Thunderbolt is able to easily take down Big Ed
      over here.

      Lorelei apologizes for accosting us, and explains in more detail that
      "after what happened to Sabrina" they've been trying to crack down on
      Shayton's goons. They're still in that Gym, for the record, so you might
      want to go and try kicking them out instead of just camping out here on
      this largely unrelated route. Whatever, I'm not here to tell you how to do
      your job. I just need to heal.

      I made a point to not look at or talk to anyone in Fuschia City yet, I
      just poked me head into the Star Beast center and then came back and dealt
      with the rest of the trainers. Just a couple more entertaining pieces of
      dialogue before we're done here: Another Lass says she wants to talk to
      Lorelei but she's too nervous, and asks me if I "know how to talk to
      girls." If there's one person who definitely doesn't know how to talk to
      girls, it's this police officer, whose text in the encounter is "Oh great,
      another woman."

      This is the last guy I actually fought out here, so I will leave you all
      with the rest of his legendary dialogue.
