      Well, our dream of hearing Megalovania by the end of this game did not
      come true, but No More Nuzzles is so much better than I could've possibly
      dreamed. What a perfect track for this final battle against a guy named
      Varik.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boy, I got lucky with full paras in this battle. I also made sure to get
      some Wrap action in for this fight: It really helped against Marbitar,
      although I'll admit it maybe wasn't strictly necessary against Floratress.
      Still it was quite poetic that our two oldest team members combined their
      powers to take down Varik's ace, right? Especialy with using Wrap, the
      thing this series is named after. And you all get to watch every single
      Wrap in real time, just like I did during the playthrough, how awesome is
      that.
    </p>

      Varik brings out the waterworks over his parents, as is typical. We get to
      see an accidentally placed extra space character, we enter our Beasts into
      the Hall of Fame and we're played out to Cha La Head Cha La. Folks, that's
      Star Beasts!
    </p>

      You can look forward to at least one bonus episode containing my full
      review-style thoughts on the game, but for now: Thank you so much for
      reading if you've gotten this far, I hope it's been as fun for you as it's
      been for me. And if you're reading this the day it releases, I hope you
      have a very Merry Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>See you!</p>
