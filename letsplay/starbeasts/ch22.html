    <p class="centertext bigtext">Episode 22: Lucian Goes To Rehab</p>
    <p>
      Having handily just obtained a Flying type from our Soul revival, I
      grabbed it out of the PC and taught it Fly to head back to Viridian City.
      While I was teaching TMs though, I decided to check in on Fire Blast: Once
      again all but one member of our team can learn it. (Zorotl can't,
      naturally. So I won't be able to waste it on a Water Beast.) I decided I'd
      teach it to The Peeker over Super Fang: The Wrap strategy means we more
      often need a finishing move rather than something that can deal damage up
      front, and I think having another type's worth of coverage is going to be
      more important than whatever value Super Fang will add.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that out of the way, it's time to see who this mystery Gym Leader is
      after all.

      Even Speako, the most wise person I know, doesn't know who Viridian's Gym
      Leader is. If even Speako cannot help us, we may be truly doomed. But I
      will give it my all in any case.

      Among the trainers of the gym are two new Beasts and one new Trainer
      class, confirmed the Rangers take the place of Cooltrainers here. Most of
      the dialogue seems disappointingly similar to the original game, although
      there is also a police officer who says he's investigating the gym. Sounds
      like the leader is in fact Lucian based on that, but maybe it's just some
      other unrelated criminal! Who knows!

      Our two new Beasts are both final evolved forms of Beasts we'd seen
      previously, which makes sense for this late in the game. I'd be a bit
      surprised if we saw any that were completely new at this stage.

      "This is quite fortuitous for me, actually. I had planned to hunt you down
      and make an example of you, but you chose to come to me instead." It's
      gonna be so embarassing for you when I completely kick your ass on my own
      terms my dude. It sure seems like he's taking his losses pretty hard,
      judging by his first Beast out.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/drunkongo2.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>you doing alright bro</i>

    </figure>
    <p>
      I'm not sure what the accuracy is on Hyper Voice in this game, but
      Drunkongo missed one on the only chance it got to attack, and Zorotl took
      it down with two neutral Surfs. Disappointly, none of the rest of his team
      are new Beasts either: After Drunkongo was Mosston, who went down to two
      Tubi Flash Cannons and only had a mediocre Rock Slide to offer in return.
      Cracture, who I guess doesn't have an evolution, was in next, and Tubi
      stayed in to take it down with two Strengths. Its move of choice here was
      Drill Peck, which is kind of funny but is also a pretty awful choice of
      move for this matchup. Embalmak likewise went down with no trouble to a
      pair of Super-effecive Flash Cannons, and we were left with Lucian's ace.
    </p>

        <i>we've officially crossed the level 50 threshold folks</i>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Hilariously, it seems like Predatox doesn't have any moves that can hit
      Tubi. It showed both Sludge Bomb and Poison Fang, and if it had a move
      that could do anything I would've thought it would use it here. Then
      again, we've seen the AI select ineffective moves several times in this
      playthrough, so I'm not sure. In any case, giving a boss Beast a moveset
      of only Poison attacks in a game with this many Steel types is a pretty
      hilarious decision, although probably not one that should stay in the
      game, lol.

      After a brief moment of disbelief, Lucian takes his defeat shockingly
      gracefully, saying that we've shown him his "time in this region is over."
      Could it be? Hinting at a Star Beasts 2? Probably not, but wouldn't that
      be just the funniest thing in the world. Either way, he's gone, hopefully
      to rehab if that Drunkongo was any indication.

      The SummitBadge is now ours, as is a TM for Fissure that I have 0
      intention of ever using. In any case, it's time we set a course for
      Victory Road, but not before saying hello to Varik one last time. (Well,
      other than the <i>last</i> last time.)

      I led with Rowsdower since knew he would be leading with Gryphern. A
      Thunderbolt wasn't quite enough to knock the bird down, but Rowsdower was
      able to tank a Flamethrower quite well. Up next is another of a Beast we
      just saw for the first time earlier today.

      Sculpitar, this guy's first stage was Rock/Ground, but now that it has
      wings I speculated that it might now be something like Rock/Flying. With
      that in mind, I went for a speculative Thunderbolt, which did not work. So
      it's at least still Ground, also evidenced by it hitting Rowsdower with an
      Earthquake that obviously took him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zorotl cleaned up Marbitar with a Surf, and Harlefinn came out next. My
      best guess as to this thing's type was Water/Poison, since it used Poison
      Fang whenever I fought it so I went for a Psychic: Turns out, it's
      Water/Dark, and Zorotl gets Lovely Kissed to sleep for that mistake. Bad
      day for me making the wrong call on immunities, I guess. I went into Tubi,
      who two shot it with Strength, but did get paralyzed by a Dragonbreath
      which makes me less likely to want to leave it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out to Rocky Dan for Beourgeist for Earthquake purposes, and
      learned that it still hasn't gotten a better Fire move than Ember. While
      that is pretty funny, it was quick to shut me up by giving Rocky Dan a
      Burn that stopped Earthquake from being a one-hit-KO. I was able to take
      it down in two hits, but Rocky Dan's HP was quite low and it was going to
      die to the burn on the next turn anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Level 50 Majivich was Varik's next to last Beast, and I decided to just
      sac Rocky Dan here, clicking Explosion on the off chance it missed a move
      or something. It actually went for Confuse Ray, so my Explosion was
      successful and even one-shot it through the burn.

      Finally, Floratress is here to make a valiant last stand. I decided to
      give The Peeker a shot, especially since we've got that exciting new Fire
      Blast now. I got a Thunder Wave off easily, and it showed me Counter. I'm
      not too worrid about that, The Peeker's only Normal/Fighting move is Wrap,
      which I'm fairly confident it's impossible to Counter. (But Counter in RBY
      is wack so who knows maybe there's a shenanigan.) Unfortunately, after
      only a handful of Wraps I miss one and it gets off a Brick Break, putting
      The Peeker to 4 HP. Backed into a corner, I go for a Fire Blast. It barely
      lives but a (not-very-effective, apparently) Crunch is able to clean up
      after it goes for another Counter on the Fire Blast turn.

      Victory Road is now all that stands between us and the end of the game.
      It's been a hell of a ride, and I can't wait to see how it all ends.
