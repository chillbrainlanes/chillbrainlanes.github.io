    <p class="centertext bigtext">Episode 2: The Final Sacrifice</p>
    <p>
      With Varik dealt with, you might say we're "On the Road to Viridian City".
      The guy who gives out the potion is here with the same role as always, but
      he oddly says his name here (Justin). I wonder if that's just a dev
      calling out one of their friends. Or maybe Justin will be an incredibly
      important recurring character, who knows. Of course, with our first tall
      grass comes our first new Star Beast.

      Just being a generic animal definitely makes me assume this is a Vast Fame
      original rather than a new design, although if I ever saw that for a
      Starbie that actually was a new design I'm gonna feel like a real asshole.
      This thing's also got Poison Sting, so it's another good candidate for
      being the reason behind the PC Antidote. I Wrap a couple into the dirt for
      the experience here.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a grueling journey we arrive at Viridian City. The first thing that
      catches my eye is the Chansey replacement in the Starbie Center. Once we
      find a center without someone rudely standing in the way, we should be
      able to learn what this thing's name is. But for now it remains a mystery.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/caterpillars.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>i'm gonna start asking random people on the street this</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This NPC offers to helpfully explain to us about the two kind of
      caterpillar. According to the expert, Mulcrunch eats meat, while Cupeedle
      doesn't, and Mulcrunch is stronger but slower while Cupeedle is fast but
      "a bit flimsy". However, they're apparently both "really useful". I wonder
      if Shi Kong Xing Shou had two different bug families like this or if one
      or both of these are Star Beasts originals. Once I'm finished with the
      game I'll have to see if I can find a list of all of the original game's
      creatures so I can learn definitely who comes from where.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/radiations.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >don't feed your vulpine starbies too many, otherwise you mind end up
          with some kind of radiation fox</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The other notable changed dialogue that I found on this first trip is this
      guy in the Mart, who says that the shop "sells many RADIATIONs. I mean,
      ANTIDOTEs." This is almost certainly another oblique reference, and if all
      of them are as specific as that Ashens reference from earlier I should
      probably get used to not being in on the joke for a lot of this game's
      flavor text. In any case, we pick up Cherry's Parcel and we're ready to
      head back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything goes as expected, we get the Stardex and head back north. On
      the way back up through Route 1 though, I do learn of a second Starbie
      that can spawn there.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/roc.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>pulled out all the stops for this one</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Not really anything to write home about, but the name just being "Roc"
      means this was definitely another port from the original, so I can't be
      too upset. It's not like the real Pokémon games don't have just as many
      forgettable birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pick up some Star Balls once I'm back in Viridian so we can start
      formally putting together our team. Before we leave Viridian, I definitely
      want to check the grass on Route 22 for any new Starbies and take on the
      optional Rival fight. And new Starbies are exactly what I find.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/slimogg.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >my brother said this sprite was "so big" which it doesn't feel
          especially big to me but maybe he's right to expect a level 2 dog to
          be smaller? idk</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I'm pretty sure this isn't actually our lost dog, but it's someone's lost
      dog. My Poison Stings being not very effective confirm that this is a
      Poison type, which makes me not especially interested in adding it to the
      team for now.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/spriggle.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>he really said ".w."</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now this guy I can really get down with. The continuity of the angle of
      the stick is a little fucked up on the sprite, but maybe it's just a bendy
      stick. It also has the move Sharpen which is novel, cool to see that move
      getting some wider disribution. I decided to look around a bit more before
      committing to catch it though.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/zapodi.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>now is</i> this <i>one my dog?</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now we're talking. Honestly, I enjoy this design but I don't quite love it
      as much as Spriggle. However! This team is going to want one or maybe even
      two Electric types on it if we're trying to build with Wrap, for Thunder
      Wave purposes. I'm not sure I'll be keeping this dog on my team long-term,
      but I think it'll be nice to have in the short term. It had the move Bite
      in the battle, but I'm not actually sure if Dark is a type in this game or
      if it's just Normal. But we're catching it, so we'll find out.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/zapodidex.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >"They make their nests near sources of electricity. They chew up
          wires and batteries for sustenance."</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In addition to being a better way of disposing of car batteries than
      throwing them in the ocean, Zapodi has something of an X-Factor. Not only
      is Bite indeed a Dark-type move here, but Zapodi is also Electric/Dark,
      meaning it's already got a 60 power stab move on a pretty strong Special
      stat. This game doesn't have the Physical/Special split which is fine, but
      it does make Zapodi's other move being Screech pretty funny. Screech is
      actually pretty good, but as of now it has no moves that can actually make
      use of it. (Testing this in a Zapodi mirror match is how I got the chance
      to test if Phys/Spec was in the game). Oh well, just from the first couple
      battles using this it's already doing huge damage with Bite to things that
      are the same level, so I think he'll be a great addition to the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yeah, and when I think of "Zap" there's only one name that comes to
      mind. So welcome to the team, Rowsdower.
    </p>

        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      At this point I started training Rowsdower to get him to roughly the same
      level as Mr. Bungle, since they'll probably be my main two fighters for
      the foreseeable future. After running around in this grass for a while
      two-shotting scorpions and birds with Bite, I've realized that despite
      being the first thing I ever got on this route that Slimogg seems to
      actually be a pretty rare encounter. So even though I said I wasn't
      planning on making it a permanent addition to the team, I decided I might
      as well catch one once I found a second one. So that's what I did.

    <p>
      Welcome to the team, Stanko. You're probably just going to be switching
      into things and getting knocked out. But you're a Poison/Normal type and
      you've got Scratch, so if you do get a free turn you do have a decent
      button to click with it at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      With two team members ready to go, it's time to rematch Varik. Same
      dialogue here as the original. He's added a Roc to his team, which isn't
      too surprising since it's filling the role of the Spearow on the original
      rival's team.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      While Rowsdower is favored in this matchup since Gust actually has been
      updated to Flying in this game (Did you know Gust was Normal in RBY?
      Pretty funny stuff), a couple Sand Attacks and a 3 level disadvantage
      means I can't actually beat this bird 1 on 1. Bungle picks up the knockout
      with some classic Wrap goodness, and not only scores a level up but also
      learns Water Gun, which will be a huge help. Not so much against Quincy,
      who comes in next and has Leech Seed and Harden, but Bite being Special
      allows Rowsdower to take it down. Good teamwork, fellas.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point I was about ready to head back and start for Viridian
      Forest, but there was something strange that caught my eye.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/viridiancave.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >real attentive gamers will remember this cave from the rowsdower
          action figure edit</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Gee, this cave entrance wasn't here before. What wonders lay ahead? (The
      wonder was a bug).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/viridiancave2.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i>dude, lunge? awesome bug type reference</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The cave, or at least the accessible part of it, is very tiny. But in this
      little area is some sort of creature with the beetle sprite. Apprently, it
      was responsible for digging this tunnel, but it got lost trying to get
      home. Amateur mistake, to be honest, and now it has resorted to violence.
      That's not going to solve anything, man!
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img class="inlineimage centerimage" src="images/slashopper.png" />
      <figcaption class="centertext">
        <i
          >unrelated but i really like that rowsdower is doing the "nya" thing
          with his paw in this back sprite</i
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In my infinite wisdom, I didn't decide it was worth healing before I tried
      to battle this bug, so now I'm stuck with a very weak party up against a
      Level 10(!!!) bug with a Scratch that took care of both of my remaining
      creatures in one strike each. After blacking out I returned for a rematch,
      only for Rowsdower to once again be felled in one turn by a super
      effective Double Kick, and Mr. Bungle only barely fared any better.
      Clearly we are dealing with no ordinary Slashopper. This is a true force
      of nature. Even the mighty power of Stanko, the level 3 Slimogg was
      nothing in the face of its Scratching prowess. We were gonna need to grind
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's back to the Scorpsy mines. Or so I thought! After another
      blackout, the first encounter back on Route 22 was a hitherto unseen
      beast. Perhaps our meeting here was fate, the destined hero who has come
      to slay the mighty Level 10 Grasshopper Thing.
